Tessa sat at the large mahogany table of their host's dining room, slowly sipping a glass of red wine. She had been coming to these monthly parties for a year, but she had decided that tonight would be her last one. They simply did not hold her interest anymore. And it didn't help that every time she was here, she had to endure a dinner with Quinn. How she hated that man. Ever since high school they had detested each other.

When she had first met him, she had initially been attracted to him. He was tall and well-built and had played on multiple sports teams back in school, most notably as a linebacker for the football team. His muscles were thick and hard while his dark, full hair always fell wildly into his deep blue eyes. But that girlish crush had quickly morphed into hatred once the animosity between them began.

It had all started over a friendly competition their sophomore year over a school fundraiser, of all things. But it had quickly spiraled into anger when she had beaten him, causing him to not only lose a bet he had made amongst his friends but to also lose face in front of most of their class. How that was her fault, she had never understood. She hadn't even been aware of the bet that he had made, or the embarrassment and hazing he had suffered from his 'friends' when he had lost. But he had been so used to winning that when he had lost to a petite scrap of a girl, he had not taken it well and had taken his anger out on her at school any chance he got. His bullying had been legendary. And ever since then, things had been ugly between them.

Tessa took some responsibility for it. She knew how much winning meant to him so she had made a point to enter every competition that he was involved in just because she knew it drove him crazy when she won, and there was nothing that he could do about it. It had given her a twisted sense of satisfaction. She told herself it was justified after what he had put her through after her initial fundraising win. If his ego was so fragile that he could not stand to lose to a girl, she would make sure he suffered that indignation often. Their friends had always laughed it off as high school drama and had watched the feud between them with gleeful entertainment. But for she and Quinn, the anger and bitterness had been very real.

Despite having graduated from high school over seven years ago, the animosity between them had only grown throughout the years. She had managed to keep her distance from him after graduation, even though they had ended up going to the same college. It had been a big campus and they had majored in different subjects. But they shared a large group of mutual friends and were bound to run into each other at the occasional party. Tessa had wanted to let the past go and even tried to apologize once for being so childish, but he had refused to accept it. The evening had ended with him knocking a bowl full of dip into her lap, to which she had retaliated by throwing a plastic cup of beer at his head. Ever since then, they had given each other a wide berth. But now here they were, three years after their college graduation, being forced into social situations together once again.

After college, they had all become busy with their lives, but their group of about fifteen friends had been determined to stay close. Afterall, many of them had all known each other since they were kids. So once a month they met at one of their houses, each of them taking a turn to host. It was a time to get caught up on each other's busy lives while sharing a good meal and some drinks with friends. But it needled her that Quinn was here. They had always moved in the same social circles, so it had not been surprising that he had been included when the group had been formed, but that didn't mean she liked it. She had almost walked right out of the group's first meetup, but her best friend had convinced her to stay. She tried to keep her distance from Quinn and their friends knew them well enough to know not to ever seat them together. Yet it was easy to see from his hard looks and angry eyes that he had never given up the old rivalry.

Tessa and her friends had all managed to do quite well for themselves since college, and their monthly parties were usually quite elaborate affairs. They got dressed up in their best and sampled opulent food and expensive wines. Tessa had never hosted one yet, and it was unlikely that she ever would since she intended for this to be her last party. Her best friend Kate was the only one she cared to keep contact with, and she could simply do things with the woman outside this group if she stopped coming here.

Perhaps it was time for Tessa to make some new friends. That way she would not have to live with Quinn's contemptuous eyes on her once a month while making small talk with people she didn't really care about anymore. Some of the other junior lawyers from her firm had been asking her to join them for drinks. They went out to a cocktail bar near their downtown office every Friday after work. Maybe she should think about joining them next time. Especially now that her best friend Kate seemed more interested in hooking up with their current host Michael than carrying on a conversation with Tessa. The two had been flirting since high school but had never pursued each other. But lately they had been spending more and more time together. Tessa knew that they had hooked up at the last party and slept together in an unused bedroom of the last host's house. And given the fact that they had both been missing from the table since dessert, they were probably off doing the same tonight.

Tessa drained her glass of wine before she pushed her chair away from the table and excused herself. She didn't really need to go to the bathroom, but she wanted to get away from the table for a while. The conversation had been boring, just rehashing stories from the past, as they also each tried to one up each other regarding their recent successes. Besides, Quinn had been staring at her with that old anger simmering in his eyes. Yet it did not escape her notice that his eyes would linger on her chest every time that he looked at her. That was the way it had always been with him. Equal parts loathing and lust, as if he hated the sight of her face but couldn't help but imagine what he would do to her body if he could.

Good, let him imagine. His fantasies would be as close as he ever came to her.

Tessa knew that she was pretty, but she didn't try to openly flaunt it, especially not to Quinn. But she did always like to look her best and tended to wear pretty dresses to their monthly dinners. Tonight, it was a simple black number, strapless and tight around her chest while the lacy skirt flared prettily out and flounced around her legs where it fell to mid-thigh. She was wearing heels with it, giving her normally petite 5'1" frame a little extra height. Her soft, chestnut brown hair was down and fell around her in a thick cascade that hit halfway down her back.

Her heels clicked against the marble floor as she walked, tossing glances around the large house as she went. Michael was quite possibly the most well off of their group. His family had always had an air of wealth around them, but he had also done very well for himself by buying a bunch of Bitcoin in high school when everyone else had been convinced it was just a fad. Now his millions spoke volumes for his financial sense. It really wasn't a surprise that Kate had been chasing him for a while. She had always been attracted to rich and powerful men, despite the fact that she was quite well off herself from the social media empire that she had built as a lifestyle blogger. Tessa had never understood how that was a real job, but Kate certainly wasn't hurting for money with her many commercial partnerships. But that had not stopped her from pursuing Michael. If they became an actual couple after this, Tessa thought there would be no stopping them on their climb to the top of the social ladder.

Tessa found the first-floor bathroom already occupied so she made her way up the grand staircase to the second floor. She knew that there were several rooms up here. One was sure to be a bathroom. She spied one at the end of the hall but as she began to make her way toward it, she heard sounds emanating from one of the bedrooms ... Kate's voice raised in loud screams of pleasure. Kate often shared tales of her sexcapades with Tessa so she knew that her friend was very uninhibited during sex. Tessa didn't think the sounds would actually carry downstairs to the party below but she knew that Kate wouldn't care even if they did. She probably wanted everyone to know that she and Michael were fucking.

"Classy, Kate." Tess rolled her eyes as she continued toward the bathroom. But she knew that she would be able to hear them even here and the thought didn't appeal to her.

Past the bathroom was another staircase that led up to the third floor. Why had a single man bought a three-story mansion, anyway? Probably just because he could. Tessa made very good money as a lawyer but would never buy something this massive just as a display of her wealth. Instead, she had opted for a penthouse condo high over the city. Someplace close to work in the bustling downtown area that was the center of her universe.

Tessa wasn't sure how Michael would feel about her exploring his house, but he was obviously otherwise occupied so she doubted that he would notice. She decided to head for the quiet third floor just to get away from the people and noise for a bit. She could freshen up in the bathroom and return to the party before anyone even noticed that she was missing. And what did she care if they did notice? She had a feeling that she wouldn't be seeing any of them again any time soon anyway. They were all arrogant and self-absorbed. The parties had stopped being fun a long time ago.

After a quick climb up the stairs, Tessa found herself on the third floor. The air up here felt heavy and stale. She got the impression that Michael probably didn't even come up here very often. Tessa passed a few open doors -- an office, a sitting room, a couple of bedrooms -- before she found what she was looking for. A large bathroom was on her right and she slipped inside and shut the door behind her. She didn't bother to lock it. After all, she did not actually need to use the restroom and even if she did, no one was likely to come up here and bother her.

Tessa cast a glance around the large bathroom, finding it lavishly decorated. Every surface was marble and polished to a high shine. An enormous tub sat on her right while a long counter stretched along the length of the wall on her left. A couple of his-and-hers sinks nestled there but they barely took up any space on the counter at all. There was a thick, soft rug beneath her feet and fluffy matching towels hanging from the racks. Even the bathroom oozed opulence. Michael was such a pretentious asshole.

She turned on the light and found it to be adjustable, and Tessa set it on a lower setting so that her eyes were not assaulted by the obnoxious bright white light that normally flooded most bathrooms. Tessa sighed as she moved over to the counter to the clear area between the sinks and leaned forward to fix her hair and make sure her makeup was still flawless above her pretty brown doe eyes. The counter pressed against her flat belly and her position forced her breasts upward. She was a nice C cup, but her stature being so small had always made her breasts look larger than they really were. The fact that she was wearing a strapless push up bra beneath her dress helped. No wonder Quinn and been staring at her tits all night. Tessa smiled at the thought. She hated the asshole, but she loved that she had that kind of power over him. He couldn't help but look at her.

The rattle of the doorknob on her left drew her attention over to the door with a gasp.

"Occupied." Tessa called before she turned her attention back to the mirror.

The noise halted for a moment before the knob began to turn once again. Tessa looked over in annoyance, about to launch into a lecture about bathroom etiquette before the words died on her lips. The door swung open to reveal Quinn standing on the other side. His large form took up most of the door frame and all but blocked any light coming in from the hall. There was no way that he had just happened to stumble upon her here in this bathroom so far away from the main party. He must have followed her up here.

"I said this bathroom is occupied." Tessa finally snapped at him. "What part of that did you not understand?"

"I understood just fine." His voice was low as he stared at her.

"Then leave." She muttered as she turned her eyes back to the mirror and pushed her hair over her shoulders so that it flowed freely down her back. There was a silver hairbrush on the counter and she used it to smooth her thick locks down before he tossed it back onto the counter beside her.

"No." Was all he said as he stepped into the room, the door swinging shut behind him.

"What the hell do you think you're doing?" She asked in annoyance.

Still, she refused to turn away from the mirror to look at him. At that he chuckled as he began to move toward her. But Tessa noted that his hand flickered out to lock the door behind him before he started moving. The first little alarm bell sounded in her mind at the action, but she still was not fully comprehending his intent.

"I really hate you, you know that?" He rumbled as he slowly stalked toward her.

"The feeling is mutual." She was quick to assure him.

"You know, when I first met you, I thought you were cute." He informed her. By now he was standing directly behind her, his form towering over her. She watched him through the mirror as every cell in her body froze at his words. He too was studying her reflection in the mirror, staring at her face and slowly running his eyes down her body, taking his time when he reached her chest. "I didn't want to date you or anything, but I certainly wanted to fuck you. I used to imagine you getting lost and wandering into the boy's locker room after football practice. You would see me getting changed and not be able to control yourself. You would confess that you wanted me, and then let me to fuck you. And I would, right there in front of the whole team while they watched and cheered."

"You're a perv." Tessa snarled as she jerked to the left and tried to move toward the door. One of his thick arms shot out and blocked her and Tessa felt anger flare within her. "Move, asshole!"

"I think you wanted me too, back then." Quinn observed as he moved and braced his other arm on her right and effectively caged her in. If she wanted out, she was going to have to duck under his arms and she had no intention of crawling around on the floor for him. Instead, she stayed facing the mirror with her back to him, refusing to play his games. "Admit it, you thought I was hot."

Tessa pressed her mouth into a thin line and refused to answer him. He wasn't incorrect, but she wouldn't give him that satisfaction of letting him know that. Besides, there had been too much water under the bridge since then. They both hated each other, so there was no going back to that initial mutual attraction.

"What, nothing to say?" He laughed at her non-response. "That's not like you. But it doesn't matter. Because I know a secret."

"What?" Tessa asked through tightly grit teeth.

"That you still find me attractive..." He murmured as he took a step in to her. Tessa gasped as she was pressed firmly into the counter and now found herself pinned by his body. Maybe she should have ducked under his arm when she had the chance.

"I think ..." He growled near her ear. "That you still want me to fuck you."

"Get the fuck off of me!" Tessa snarled as she tried to jerk away from him.

But she could not stop the blossom of heat deep down in her belly. She found herself pinned to the counter by the man that was her worst enemy as he talked about fucking her, and she was horrified to realize that it was turning her on. He was a thick wall of muscle behind her, over a foot taller than her and had her outweighed by at least a hundred pounds. He could do whatever he wanted to her right now and she would be helpless to fight it. Even if she called for help, no one from the party two floors below would ever hear her.

And for some reason ... her pussy was instantly wet as she felt a flush creep into her cheeks.

"I hate you." She forced herself to growl at him despite the heat within her belly.

"I hate you too." He grinned at her as he studied her flushed face. "But I'm right. If I'm not, just tell me to stop."

As he said it his right hand moved upward toward her chest. Even though the cage of his arms was now open on one side he still kept her pressed firmly against the counter with his solid weight. He seemed to be moving in slow motion as he ghosted his hand over her chest before he snagged the front of her dress and began to pull it downward. Tessa wanted to protest but for some reason, she could not force sound from her throat. Once he had the top of the dress down around her waist his hand moved back upward, skimming her belly before moving behind her to hook beneath the clasp of her bra. Tessa made a strangled sound as her bra fell away, but it was not the firm "no" that she had intended. Instead, it was a wanton mewl as his calloused hands moved up to cup her breasts.

"God damn it girl, I knew you had some nice tits on you." His husky voice groaned near her ear.

Tessa's chest was heaving and every breath pressed her breasts more firmly into his palms. She felt the press of his erection against her butt where he had her pinned and she realized that he was huge. Suddenly the thought of him fucking her with his huge cock filled her mind and she let out another strangled moan.

"You want this." He chuckled as he rolled her breasts in his hands before giving the nipple a firm tweak. Pain and pleasure sparked through her in equal measure, and he only pulled harder on her nipple at her response. "You like a little pain, don't you?"

Tessa gritted her teeth and refused to respond. She might not be able to control her body right now, but she would not give him the satisfaction of hearing her admit it.

"I asked you a question." He barked as one hand left her breast and snaked up into her hair. He snapped her head roughly backward and held her head against his shoulder so he could peer down at her. It felt like he was pulling her hair out from the roots. And the unnatural angle of her neck caused her to arch her back and force her breasts upward. She was standing on her tiptoes now to alleviate some of the pressure on her scalp.

"Answer me. You like a little pain, don't you?"

"Yes." The word was stuttered as it rattled out of her.

She had discovered that fact quite by accident. One of her ex-boyfriends had smacked her ass once while she had been riding him and it had sent her straight into orgasm. Yet no matter how much she had asked him to experiment with pain a little more, he had refused and eventually broken up with her over it. After that, Tessa had never asked another man to experiment with her again for fear of scaring them away.

"Good. Cause I'm not gentle." He chuckled as he released her hair before landing a slap across her breast with an open palm. Tessa gasped at the sudden shock of pain across her sensitive nipple, and he only laughed at her reaction. "Admit it, you liked that. You want me to hurt you."

"No." Tessa managed to shake her head even though her body screamed the exact opposite.

"No?" He chuckled before his hand dipped downward. Tessa only realized at the last moment where he was heading. That rough hand slipped under her skirt and pushed past the thin covering of her panties. "Then why are you soaking wet?"

"Stop..." She moaned as his finger rubbed over her pussy before dipping into the soaking folds of her flesh. He found her clit and began to rub even as he started to grind his hips into her from behind.

"Why should I stop? You're obviously enjoying it. Or are you always this wet?"

As he said it, he pulled his hand from her panties and away from her throbbing clit. Tessa made a small sound of frustration, and he chuckled as her reaction only confirmed what he already knew. His hand moved to her face and the next thing she knew he had forced his fingers into her mouth.

"Suck." He commanded. Tessa moaned but did as he instructed. She sucked her own juices from his fingers, Quinn moving them in and out of her mouth as he finger fucked her lips. "Good little whore."

Her eyes had been closed as she sucked on his fingers, but they flew open at his words. Tessa enjoyed sex but she was not hyper-sexual. She had only had a few partners in her life and everything up until this point had been pretty vanilla. She was not a whore.

But if she wasn't, then why was she sucking her own juices off the fingers of a man that she hated? And why was she loving every moment of it? He laughed at her reaction, as well as her inability to refute his words.

"I'm going to fuck you tonight." He snarled into her ear as he pulled his fingers from her mouth. His hand wrapped around her throat and squeezed slightly, forcing her to meet his eyes in the mirror. "And I'm going to give you just one chance to tell me no. Just tell me you don't want me to fuck you and I'll stop. We'll both walk away and pretend this never happened. But if you don't say it now, I'm going to make that pussy mine and I'm not going to give a fuck if you beg me to stop later. Understood?"

Tessa nodded as her eyes locked on his in the mirror. She was shuddering against him, her breasts heaving as air rattled in and out of her lungs. His eyes were wild with lust, the blue of his irises just a sliver around the dark black of his wildly dilated pupils.

"Do you want me to stop?" His words rumbled out of the chest pressed into her back and she felt their vibration down to her core.

Tessa's pride made her want to tell him to stop, but the craven lust pooling between her legs had control of her and wanted her to scream for him to fuck her. Both options seemed too horrible for her to force past her lips so she merely looked him straight in the eyes and shook her head no. At that he let out a roar-like laugh as he tightened his arms around her.

"You just made a mistake, little girl. I own you now." He informed her as he wrenched her head on his shoulder and forced it to the side at an unnatural angle.

His lips were immediately on hers, crushing her own in their need. His tongue exploded into her mouth and Tessa moaned as he invaded her. He kissed her long and deep for several minutes, all the while his hips grinding into her ass and rubbing his giant cock against the cage of his pants. The hand that was not tangled in her hair moved toward his neck as he began to loosen his tie. He had been wearing a very expensive suit jacket when he arrived, but he must have left it downstairs. He pulled off his tie and let it fall to the counter beside her before he began to unbutton his shirt at a maddening slow pace. Once it was open he did not shrug out of it. He merely let it hang open down his front as he pressed the solid wall of his muscles into her back. He finally released her mouth, and Tessa panted like a dog as her eyes flew up to him in the mirror.

"Do you want my cock?" He demanded as he pressed himself firmly into her. The counter was digging hard into her stomach now, but she did not care about the dull pain of it. Tesse did not respond. She merely gritted her teeth and turned her face to the side.

"You will answer me when I ask you a question." He snapped as he forced her head back straight so he could stare at her in annoyance. "Do you want my cock?"

"Yes ... ok?" She finally growled in anger as she tried to jerk her head away.

"Say it." He demanded. Tessa gritted her teeth and almost didn't answer him but another firm tug at her hair made her reconsider.

"Fine, I want your cock." She finally admitted as she tried to squirm away a little. "I hate you, you asshole! But yes ... I want your cock."

"I hate your smart mouth." He frowned as he reached down and gave one of her nipples and hard twist. She cried out in surprise and pain and he smiled at the sound. "You have always acted like you're better than me. Always trying to embarrass me. But who's better now, whore? I own you, and it's time that you realized it."

As he said it, he reached down and gathered up her hands behind her. Before Tess even realized what he was doing he had taken up his tie and wrapped it firmly around her wrists before tying it in a tight knot. Tessa's eyes flared in surprise as she now found herself bound and helpless before him. Her arms were pulled behind her awkwardly and the lower half of her body was still pinned to the counter. She was completely at his mercy. There was something equally hot and terrifying in the realization. But from the sudden surge in juices down her leg, the former was winning.

"Look how pretty you look, all tied up." He chuckled as he studied her in the mirror.

He let her take in the view for a moment before his hands fell across her shoulders and pushed her down. Tessa was bent over the counter, her short skirt hitching up to barely cover her bottom. It didn't matter. A moment later she felt him pluck it upward and drape it over her waist. All that separated her pussy from being exposed to him was the soaking cover of her lace panties. She felt his fingers slip beneath their thin straps that ran over her hips. He played with them for a moment before he made a low, growling sound and ripped them away from her body. They tore with an audible rip and just like that, the fabric was gone.

"I'm going to keep these to remember this by." Quinn said as he stuffed the panties into the pocket of his pants.

He studied her exposed bottom for a moment before his knees began to nudge her legs open. Tessa moaned as the cool air of the bathroom hit her exposed pussy. She could tell that he was looking at her for one endless moment before he began to run his hands over her thighs and butt. She was slightly disappointed. She had been expecting him to stick his fingers back inside of her. Even though the thought of him touching her pussy was revolting, she longed for it.

"You want this, don't you?" He asked as he gave her ass a firm slap.

"Yes." She moaned as she clenched and unclenched her bound hands behind her back.

"Tell me what you want." He demanded.

"I want you to fuck me."

"Beg for it." He laughed, and she knew that he was picturing his teenage fantasies where she begged him to fuck her in front to of the football team. She was revolted by his demand, yet equally turned on. And she could not stop the distasteful words from tumbling from her mouth.

"Please fuck me Quinn!" She moaned as she wiggled her hips as if inviting him inside of her.

"Don't worry, you'll get my cock." He replied. "But you need to be taught a lesson first. You need to be punished for all of those times you embarrassed me."

Out of the corner of her eyes she saw his hand shift and grab the silver hairbrush she had been using on her hair mere minutes ago.

"No..." She wheezed when she realized what he meant to do, but it was too late. His free hand was pressed between her shoulder blades, holding her down as he brought the flat paddle of the brush down on her ass with a resounding smack. Tessa gasped as her entire body jerked but he had her pinned.

"This is for all those times in high school you thought you could embarrass me in front of everyone we knew without consequences." As he said it two more sharp slaps of the brush landed across her backside.

"Please, stop!" Tessa cried out as she tried to kick backward. But he was standing between her knees so that she was pinned, completely at his mercy.

"Remember what I said, whore?" He snarled into her ear as he continued to spank her with the hairbrush. "You already gave your consent and I warned you that once you did, I would never stop, no matter how much you begged."

Tessa cried out as more slaps rained down until the skin of her backside felt warm and throbbed with a heartbeat of its own. He finally dropped the brush and reached down to run his hands over the burning flesh of her ass cheeks.

"Look how pretty that looks." He purred as one of his hands lifted. She could tell that he was pulling something out of his pants pocket and a moment later she heard the unmistakable sound of a cell phone's camera shutter going off.

"No!" Tessa gasped when she realized that he had just taken a picture of her bare, raw ass.

"Shut up whore, or I will post this on social media for all of the world to see." He warned her. "Your hot shot law firm might have a thing or two to say about that. Now, did you learn your lesson? Are you ever going to embarrass me again or do you need another spanking?"

"No!" Tessa gasped, her eyes wild with fear. She would admit that the first few slaps had been new and exciting and had sent a strange wave of pleasure rushing through her body but by about the fifteenth blow it had just hurt. And the thought of the picture getting out at work was horrifying. "I'll never embarrass you again!"

"Good girl." He purred before his finger slipped down into her pussy. "Now that your punishment is over, we can get to what you are really begging for. And it couldn't have been that bad. You're still soaking wet. I think you like pain more than you want to admit."

Tessa let out a low sound as he began to saw his finger in and out of her. It was soon joined by a second, before a third one slipped into her quivering, wet folds. His thumb sought out her clit and began to rub. Tessa wanted to grind her hips into him but she was still pinned to the counter so all she could do was take it.

"I can tell that you are tight." His voice was a quivering breath as he continued to finger fuck her pussy. "How many men have you fucked?"

"Three." She moaned as he increased the pressure on her clit.

One had been her high school boyfriend who even now sat obliviously downstairs at the table chatting with their friends as a man she hated finger banged her two floors away. She had only been with Jake a few times before they had amicably broken up. The second was the man that had been scared by how turned on she had gotten by him slapping her ass. Three times was her number with him. And the last was a fellow lawyer at her firm, and they were not serious. They just scratched an occasional itch on the couch in his office sometimes on nights they worked late together. She didn't even need to use all her fingers to count the total number of times that she had had sex in her life. And it was humiliating that Quinn knew it.

"Only three?" Quinn laughed at her answer. "Do you even know how to take a cock? If you don't, you're going to learn tonight. Has a guy ever made you cum?"

As he said it, he began to move his fingers faster, his thumb keeping time on her swollen clit.

"Only once!" She cried out as the sensations in her body began to grow. The memory filled her mind once again, and she had to admit that long ago orgasm had not been because they had been fucking. It was because he had slapped her ass, and even then, she had been fingering her own clit at the time as she rode him. "But only because I was touching myself while he fucked me."

"Oh, little girl." Quinn purred in amusement, even though they were exactly the same age. It was patronizing and humiliating ... and Tessa found that she loved it. That sweet fire was growing in her belly and she knew that she was only seconds away from coming on his fingers. "You're going to get an education tonight."

With that he pulled his hand away and she howled in protest as that growing orgasm sputtered and died. He merely laughed gleefully at her indignation. The next thing she knew the sound a of a zipper was filling the air. She felt his enormous cock pop out of his pants and slap across the back of her ass. Tessa moaned at the feel of it as it came to rest against her thigh. She had never had a man so huge.

"I have a big dick, don't I?" He laughed down at her. "Ever been fucked by such a big cock?"

"No." The word was a sob. Her body was a tangle of ecstasy and agony and all she knew was that if he did not fuck her soon, she was going to come apart at the seams.

"What do you want me to do with this big dick?"

"Fuck me..." She moaned.

"What? I couldn't hear you." He laughed.

"I want you to fuck me!" She howled.

"Beg for it."

"Please Quinn..." The words shook as they tumbled out of her. "Fuck me hard. Please ... please..."

"Good whore." He chuckled as he slapped her already throbbing ass.

Tessa moaned at the treatment but stilled when she felt him moving behind her. She heard foil tear and felt a sudden sense of relief fill her. He was putting on a condom. She had been too busy acting like a complete slut for his cock that she hadn't even though about it. She wasn't on any kind of birth control and this could have ended very badly.

He was shifting now and she felt the fleshy head of his giant cock press into her slick pussy lips. But there is where he stopped, tormenting her yet again.

"Say it again." Came his gruff, guttural voice.

"Please fuck me!" She howled in frustration. And even as the last word left her lips, that is what he did.

Tessa cried out as he rammed his cock into her tight pussy, his giant member stretching her and filling her like no man ever had. He was not being gentle as he pushed himself inside of her. He moved slowly so as to not tear her up, but he was not concerned with being overly gentle. Finally, he bottomed out and Tessa felt his balls come to rest on the back of her thighs. He rested there a moment, his eyes hooded and his mouth hanging open slightly as he seemed to relish the tightness of her. After a moment he moved, pulling almost all of the way out of her before plunging back down. Tessa moaned as she was violated by this man that she hated, but she could not deny that she was loving every sordid moment of it.

Quinn began to thrust, his large penis impaling her with every slam of his hips. She was unable to speak. She could only produce a low rush of air from her lungs as he pounded into her from behind. There was no room left inside of her for breath.

"You're so tight." He moaned as he fucked her.

A low keen was her only reply. The sounds of his balls slapping into the flesh of her thighs filled the room as he fucked her hard. Her pussy was making a wet sound as it gripped his dick, trying to pull him back in every time he pulled back to thrust. He bottomed out every time and she felt like he was scraping her insides raw. But she could not deny the fire that was starting to grow in her belly once again.

"Come on you whore, come on my dick." He demanded when he realized what was happening.

And with a scream that is exactly what she did. She had made herself cum plenty of times either with her own hand or a vibrator, but it was nothing like what she felt in this moment. It was a good thing that the rest of the party was so far away or they definitely would know what the two of them were doing in here. But despite the orgasm that had just rocked her, Quinn was not done with her yet.

Once again he grabbed her by her hair and jerked her head up to his shoulder. Her hands were still pinned behind her and the unnatural angle of her neck and arms forced her tits outward.

"Watch me fuck you." He demanded as he continued to pound into her.

The way he held her head made her keep her face toward the mirror and she dared not close her eyes. Instead, she watched him rut behind her, her tits bouncing with each thrust of his hips. He was grunting now, the only other sound besides the slapping of their skin. Her nipples stood out hard from her breasts and her face had a pretty flush. But there was nothing pretty about the animalistic ecstasy on her face. She was tied up and helpless, being punished and used by a man she found to be vile. But she had already cum for him and could already feel herself rushing toward her next orgasm. His eyes never lifted from her face in the mirror as he watched her unravel.

"You're cuming again, aren't you whore?" His smile was animalistic as his penis slammed into her again.

"Yes!" She gasped, barely able to get the word past her locked throat.

"Scream for me, slut." He commanded as he reached in front of her and gave her nipple a firm squeeze. That did it for her. How did he know that pain during the height of her pleasure would push her over the edge? She came with a shrill cry, her wild eyes locked on the mirror as she came for him. Her pussy locked around him like a vice and she heard his answering roar as he buried himself bells deep in her pussy and came. His cock jerked wildly within her as every muscle in his body locked. He was pressing her so tightly onto the counter that she knew it would bruise but she didn't care.

Finally, his body seemed to unlock and lose support. He sagged against her, Tessa's body once again being pressed roughly down to the counter.

Tessa couldn't form a coherent thought. All she could do was pant and try to draw in shuddering gasps of air. It was not easy with his massive weight compressing her lungs and his large dick still lodged firmly inside of her. Like that they laid for several endless moments, the smell of sex heavy in the air around them.

"God damn, your pussy is magic." He finally groaned as he pushed himself off her. Tessa moaned as his dick slipped out of her with a wet sound and limply hit his thigh. Quinn merely laughed at her reaction. "Miss my dick already?"

Tessa shifted uncomfortably now that his weight was off her back but she could not muster the strength to lift her head.

"We should get back to the party soon. Can't have them thinking we slipped off somewhere to fuck, right princess?" He chuckled as he took her by her shoulders and lifted her up. Once again her bound hands were pressed between them and her head fell limply back across his shoulder. "I like how you look like this. In fact..."

His voice turned thoughtful as he scooped up his cell phone that was laying forgotten on the counter. Tessa didn't have the presence of mind to protest as he took a quick selfie of them in the mirror.

"Any time I want to jerk off, I'm going to look at this picture and think of your screams." He informed her as he set the cell phone back down. "If you're a good girl and do as you're told, I won't show it to anyone else."

Tessa felt a shudder rip through her at the threat that she could hear in his voice. He gave her a moment to think about it before he stepped back and pulled her away from the counter. She wobbled when he was not there to support her any longer, but he seemed unbothered by her weak legs. Instead, he used them to his advantage and pushed her down to the floor.

"Down on your knees, bitch." He snarled at her as he peeled the condom off his limp dick. Even when it was no longer hard, it was still the largest cock that she had ever seen. "Clean me up."

"You need to untie me." She protested as she tipped her head at the hand towels dangling from a nearby rack.

"Not with a towel." He snapped as he grabbed her face in his hands and pulled her toward his groin. "With your mouth."

She looked up at him in incomprehension for a moment and found him to be smirking back down at her.

"Get going bitch, or that picture is going straight to your boss."

With that he took his limp dick in his hand and pressed the tip of it to her lips. Tessa shuddered but did as told. She had always hated giving head. It just seemed so unclean. She had sucked on men before, but she had never let one come in her mouth. But Quinn did not seem like he wanted her to suck him off. He just wanted her to lick him clean and then hopefully he would let her get dressed and return to the party like nothing had ever happened. So Tessa compliantly took him into her mouth. She could taste his cum and she began to lick it from his warm skin.

"Mmm ... good girl." He smiled as she lapped at him. She was careful to clean the entire length of him, going wherever his hands directed. Her own were still tightly bound behind her and useless to protest. Finally, he was clean and she could taste no more cum as she licked along the length of him. Tessa tried to pull away, but his hands kept her firmly rooted in place.

"Where do you think you're going?" He asked as he pushed her head back down. "Your mouth feels so good. You're making me hard again."

Even as he said it, she could tell that it was true. His penis was starting to perk up again, the once limp member beginning to grow large as blood rushed to his groin once again.

"You got to come twice and me only once. That's not fair." He informed her as he pulled his dick from her mouth. It was hard and large now and he rubbed the tip of it over her cheeks before he jerked his hips and slapped her across the face with it. "Suck me off, whore."

"No..." She protested as she tried to pull her head away. "I don't like it and I'm not even good at it."

"You're about to get good." He informed her as he grabbed the hair roughly on either side of her face and pressed the head of his cock into her lips. "Remember the pictures, whore. But before I send them to everyone we know, I will punish you so severely that that last spanking will feel like a few love taps."

Tessa moaned at the threat and forced herself to open her mouth. The tip of his cock slipped into her mouth and she forced herself to run her tongue over the mushroom of precum she found there.

"I better not feel teeth." He warned her as he began to push the length of him into her throat. Her lips were stretched tight around him as his girth filled up her mouth. She felt herself begin to gag and she fought the spasms as tears watered her eyes. He was so big. How as she supposed to take the entire length of him?

"That's right, choke on it, you whore." He growled. She moaned as he began to thrust into her mouth, each one deeper than the next. Panic was starting to grip her as her air was cut off, but she attempted to bob her head and find a rhythm where she could breathe in between his thrusts.

"Mmm ... you're so good at this." He purred as he fucked her face, her tongue working over the length of him as she began to suck his thrusting dick. She was actively trying to get him off now. The faster he came, the faster this would be over. She felt the tip of him ram the back of her throat and, yet again, she tried not to gag. "Look at me."

Tessa lifted her eyes to find him watching her suck him off and was horrified to find his phone in his hands once again. She heard no shutter clicks this time and knew that he was recording her as she gave him head. Tessa moaned and attempted to shake her head but there was nothing she could do except take his dick down her throat and hope for it to be over.

"Suck my dick harder, whore." He demanded, and Tessa endeavored to comply.

The wet sound of his dick in her mouth coupled with her moans and her small gags filled the air. His hips were moving to meet her every time she pulsed her head forward. The camera never wavered. He was capturing every moment of this humiliation. Soon his hips began to speed up and she knew he was drawing closer to the edge.

"When I cum, you better swallow every drop." He demanded as he began to ram into her mouth with such force that it hurt.

Tessa's entire body revolted at his words, but she was terrified to disobey. She didn't think her ass could take another spanking, and her career definitely could not take the humiliation of this video surfacing. A moment later, he shoved his dick as far down her throat as she could take and emptied himself inside her. Tessa felt tears squeeze past her eyes as she took his cum down her throat and frantically swallowed it. He held her there, one hand balled in her air with her forehead on his stomach and his balls against her chin. Only when Tessa's lungs began to scream for air did he allow her to pull her head away. His dick slid out of the suction of her mouth with a satisfying pop and hung limply before her.

"For someone who doesn't like to suck dick, you sure are good at it." He informed her before he shut the cell phone off and set it on the counter. He stared down at her for a moment before he wiped a small dribble of cum off her chin with his thumb. "You missed some."

As he said it, he shoved his cum covered thumb into her mouth and made her lick it clean. Finally, he seemed satisfied and stepped away from her. Tessa did not move. Her hands were still bound behind her so there was nowhere for her to go anyway. Instead, she huddled limply against the counter and watched as he pulled his pants back up. Ever so carefully he rebuttoned his shirt and tucked it neatly into his pants. He made sure his hair looked nice and used a nearby hand towel to wipe the sweat from his face before he reached down and finally hauled her to her feet. He spun her back to the counter once again but this time he did not pin her there. He merely untied the tie from around her wrists. Tessa moaned as she brought her hands back in front of her and massaged her numb skin. Every part of her hurt. Her ass was red, her pussy throbbed, her throat was sore and the corners of her mouth were stretched painfully tight. But the aftereffects of the pleasure were there as well. She could not forget that she had just had two of the most powerful orgasms of her life.

"I like how you look right now." He informed her as he began to refasten his tie. "Used. Abused. Helpless. I own you now. Admit that you loved having my dick in you."

"I loved it." Tessa finally admitted sourly. It was the truth, but she hated it.

"Michael told me that Kate let him know that you planned to quit our dinner club after tonight. That won't be happening now." Quinn informed her.

"You can't tell me what to do in my free time." Tessa scoffed, the old anger seeping into her once again. He might have just fucked her like an animal while she enjoyed every second of it, but she still hated this man, and she would be damned if her pride allowed him to affect her life at all once they left this room.

"I beg to differ." He smirked at her as he tapped on his cell phone. "You belong to me now, and you will do as I say. But I think even without these pictures you would still come back for more. Admit it."

Tessa pressed her lips together in a thin line and refused to admit anything even though there was some deep dark part of her that already knew the truth. She would have come to the next dinner party just for a chance to get used by him again. Even though she was refusing to admit it, he could still see the truth in her eyes.

"Next month I want you to wear that red dress that you wore to Andrea's birthday party last year. The tight one. You will not wear a bra or panties underneath."

"But that dress is too sheer. If it's cold..."

"I want to see your nipples so hard they could cut glass through that dress. And get your pussy waxed the day before. Is that understood?" He demanded as he reached to slap his hand over one breast and set it bouncing.

Reluctantly Tessa nodded her head. She was going to have to be careful not to bend over at the next party. If she did, that dress was so short it would show everyone her pussy.

"And one more thing. I only wore a condom this time because I don't know your birth control situation. You have until next month to get that taken care of because next time, I'm fucking you bareback."

As he said it, he reached behind her and gave a sharp slap on her aching ass before he pushed away from the counter. He said not another word as he unlocked the backroom door and slipped out into the hall. The door swung shut behind him and Tessa was left staring after him in shock for a moment before she stumbled across the bathroom and locked the door behind him. It was not that she thought he would come back. He had made it very clear that he was finished with her for the night. But now she was terrified of someone else walking in on her. Tessa turned back to the counter and turned on the faucet, letting it heat up to almost scalding before she wet down a hand towel and began to clean herself up. She took her time getting dressed and checked her makeup and brushed her hair smooth before she stepped away from the mirror. 

She looked normal, but she certainly did not feel that way. And it did not help that he had taken her panties so now her bare pussy was exposed under her dress. Tessa smoothed the skirt down around her legs before she took a deep breath and moved away from the counter. She let herself back out into the house and began to make her way through the night dark halls. She climbed down to the second floor, passing by Michael's room as she made her way toward the grand staircase. The door stood open and there were no more sounds of sex from within so Kate and Michael must have been done. Carefully Tessa descended to the first floor and immediately heard the sounds of the party in the dining room. She found all within just as it was when she had left. Her friends were still talking over wine as laughter and chatter filled the air. Kate was back in the spot beside Tessa's empty seat while Michael and Quinn now chatted further down the table.

"There you are." Kate gasped at the sight of her. "Where have you been?"

"I just took a little walk. I needed some air." Tessa shrugged and she slid down into her seat. She winced at the pain of her sore ass cheeks and even though Quinn's eyes never shifted directly to her, she could see him smirk and knew that he had caught it out of the corner of his eye. Tessa shifted so that her weight was on one hip and attempted to make herself comfortable.

"Are you enjoying yourself?" Kate asked. "I wish you would reconsider quitting the dinner club..."

"I have." Tessa cut her off. "I'll continue to come. At least, for one more month."

Beyond that month, Tessa had no idea what would happen. She refused to think about it. She forced Quinn from her mind and settled into a nice conversation with her best friend. After several minutes she heard her cell phone ding with a text message. Tessa quickly picked it up. All of her friends were here in this room with her. It was probably a text from work. But when she opened it, she found a new message with an attachment waiting from Quinn. One quick glance revealed that he was ignoring her, acting like nothing was amiss. Tessa made sure that no one could see her phone screen before she opened the attachment. The sight of her red ass cheeks immediately filled the screen. Her face was turned away in the picture, but she could clearly see it reflected in the mirror. Tessa gasped as she quickly hit delete. Tessa felt shame and humiliation flare within her as heat rose to her cheeks. But not even she could deny that some of that heat was from excitement. Something warm stirred in her belly at the memory of that giant cock ramming into her pussy.

Suddenly, next month felt so far away.

Tessa sat at the dinner table of Seth's house, her eyes skipping around the faces of her friends. She was trying to look anywhere but at Quinn, but it was difficult. She had felt his heavy eyes on her for most of the meal, running over her chest every chance he could get. It did not help that the AC was blasting and it was freezing in the house. Her nipples stood out hard against the thin fabric of her dress and she knew that Quinn was not the only one staring at her chest tonight. It was humiliating and somehow still a turn on.

The ding of her phone alerted her to a text message, and she scooped it up to find one from Quinn.

<strong>You look fucking hot tonight, whore.</strong>

His words from the small screen taunted her. Tessa sighed and rolled her eyes as she turned her phone back off. Almost immediately it dinged again. Tessa didn't dare look at Quinn as she glanced back down at her phone.

<strong>But you look better like this.</strong>

Tessa dreaded what she feared she might find, but she forced herself to open the attachment that he had sent her. Her own face filled the phone screen, her eyes staring prettily upward as she sucked on Quinn's giant dick. Quickly she deleted the picture from her phone. He must have taken a screen grab from the video he had made.

Another ding.

<strong>Admit it. You like the taste of my cum.</strong>

Tessa ignored him and set her phone face down on the table beside her plate. He didn't seem upset that she was ignoring him. He merely smirked at her from across the table and went back to eating his dessert. For her part, Tessa tried to concentrate on the conversation that she had been having with Kate and Andrea.

After dessert was finished the wine began to flow. Tonight, she accepted a glass of white as Seth made his way around the table with a bottle.

"I'm gonna go have a smoke." Quinn announced after a moment before he pushed himself up. Again, Tessa refused to look at him. A few people called goodbye as he slipped from the room. A few moments later she heard the back door open and close.

"What did you think of the pie?" Kate was saying as she gestured down and their cleared dessert plates. "I thought it was delicious."

"It was great." Tessa replied unenthusiastically as she sipped at her wine. The ring of her phone saved her from having to make any more small talk.

"Ignore it." Kate bade her. "Work can wait."

"Easy for you to say. You are your own boss." Tessa scoffed. With that she pressed and talk button and brought it to her ear. "Hello?"

"Hello whore." Quinn's voice rumbled in her ear. Tessa straightened in her seat as a jolt rippled through her body. Quinn was already continuing before she could say a word. "You have two minutes to get your ass out to the pool house. Take even a second longer and you'll regret it."

"Wait, that's not enough time." Tessa protested.

"Better get going." He laughed in her ear before the line disconnected.

"Shit." Tessa growled as she began to push herself up.

"Where are you going?" Kate gasped.

"Work emergency, I need to call my boss." Tessa tried to think fast and come up with a reason she needed to go outside alone. "I'll be back in a bit."

"Tell your boss he's a slave driver." Kate pouted as she moved away from the table. Tessa ignored her as she headed for the back door.

Quickly she slipped outside and hurried across the patio. Seth's backyard held a large pool and hot tub, along with a giant patio area littered with expensive furniture. Tessa made her way around the pool and toward the pool house. The first door that she found was locked and she cursed again as she rattled the handle. Quickly she hurried to the other side and found the door there unlocked. Tessa pulled the door open and tumbled inside.

"You're late." Quinn's voice emanated from the murky room before her.

"I would have made it if that door hadn't been locked." Tessa pointed out. "You did that on purpose. You set me up for failure."

"Maybe so." He shrugged as he moved toward her.

"Asshole." Tessa snarled as she took a step backward. Why was she here? She hated this man. No amount of orgasms would ever change that.

"There's that smart mouth that I hate." He snarled as he took a stalking step toward her.

Tessa tried to jump back to the door, but he was already on her. The next thing she knew he had grabbed her by her wrist and twisted it up behind her. Tessa moaned as she stood on her tiptoes to alleviate the pressure. As she did, it hiked her already impossibly short skirt upward and exposed her pussy to him. She was panty-less and freshly waxed as he had demanded, and her bald pussy glistened with her already flowing juices.

"At least you listened." He said as he reached down to cup the mound between her legs. "Even if you can't follow simple orders and get someplace on time."

"You're a bastard." She growled up at him.

"Guilty." He laughed as his hand slipped down into his pocket. From it he produced a pair of handcuffs. "I came prepared this time."

As he said it, he snapped the handcuffs around her wrists. This time they were bound in front of her. The moment she was secure he spun her in his arms and forced her toward the door. For a moment she thought that he was going to make her go outside with him and fuck her on the lawn chairs for all to see. But at the last moment he lifted her shackled hands upward and slipped them over a coat hook on the back of the door. It was high above her head, and she was forced up onto her tiptoes once again. She gave the hook a tug, but it was secure. She now was bound facing the door, helpless with her back to him.

"I brought a few toys from home." He informed her as he produced a gag from his pocket. He slipped the ball of it into her mouth before tightening the strap around her head. "Comfy, princess?"

"Fugg ew!" She tried to yell at him. Her words were muffled but he still understood.

"No, but I'm going to fuck you. Repeatedly. But first ... I warned you that there would be a punishment if you were late."

Tessa heard a rustling sound behind her and craned her neck to find him taking off his belt. She jerked and tried to pull her hands off the hook, but it was too high. Quinn pulled her tight skirt all the way up so it was bunched around her waist, exposing her entire lower half to him.

"You brough this on yourself." He warned her before there was a zipping sound and the first belt lash fell across her ass. Tessa jumped and screamed at the pain, but it was muffled by the gag.

In that instant she knew that he had planned this. Why else bring the gag other than to keep her from screaming so loudly that it alerted the others? The fact that he had been thinking about her all this time and planning what he was going to do was somehow hot. She felt heat rush straight to her pussy even as he landed another blow across her ass. She jumped and screamed once again but somehow there was pleasure mixed in with the pain in her voice.

Another delicious lash of his belt, another confusing jolt of pleasure to her pussy.

Over and over he whipped her, not stopping until her backside was throbbing. There was a pause where she heard another click of a camera shutter before she felt him slide up behind her.

"Look at that work of art." He was right behind her now, the heat of his body maddeningly close to her. He lifted his phone to show her, and she found yet another close-up picture of her ass, this time with an intricate web of red welts crisscrossing her flesh.

Quinn moved over to a nearby bookstand and propped up his phone, taking great care as he positioned it just right. Tessa was horrified to realize that he was setting it up to record the whole thing. She could see the length of her body on the view screen. The phone gave a happy beep as he pressed the record button, and a red light came on to indicate that it was now recording her humiliation.

Quinn smirked at her as he sauntered toward her. Once he reached her, he took her by her shoulders and flipped her around. Her hands were still secured to the hook above her, but she now found herself facing him.

"Let's see those tits." He murmured as he balled his hands around the stretchy fabric of her dress and guided it downward. Inch after inch of her skin was exposed to him, her tits finally bouncing free. Yet he did not stop until he pulled the dress down over her hips and let it pool to the ground beneath her feet. There she stood before him, completely naked and totally vulnerable to his whims.

"You're soaking wet again." He said as he rammed two fingers into her pussy. Tessa arched her back and tried to gain some purchase on her tiptoes. "Do you always get this wet, or is it just for me?"

As he said it he shoved his fingers up as far as they would go and began to undulate them inside of her. Tessa moaned as he hit her g-spot and felt a red haze of pleasure tear through her.

"It's just for me, isn't it?" He goaded as he fingered her. "You dirty whore, getting so turned on by someone you hate. But you've never been fucked by a real man, have you?"

She moaned as she began to grind her hips into his hand. He chuckled at her response as he reached between them and unzipped his pants. His cock immediately sprang free, large and hard as it searched for her. Quinn gave her not a moment to prepare herself. The next thing she knew his hands were beneath her thighs, lifting her up and guiding her legs around him. With one deep thrust he rammed his cock into her. Tessa's head rolled back with a moan at the feel of him. The weight of her body was dragging her downward and impaling her on his cock, the feel of it driving her half to madness.

"You're so wet." He groaned as he began to fuck her.

Tessa was pinned between him and the door, the cool wood behind her pressing into her throbbing ass as he pounded into her. He grunted with every thrust, slamming into her as hard as he could. Tessa took the pain and reveled in it. She began to moan into her gag as his hips worked into a steady rhythm. All she could do was wrap her legs as tightly around him as they would go and let the sensations take her.

Quinn said nothing else as he fucked her. His grunts and groans spoke for him as her own moans rumbled from the back of her throat. He buried his face in her shoulder and she felt his hot breath burst against her skin before his lips claimed her neck. He was sucking and biting, Tessa not even caring that he might be leaving marks. She was so tied up in in her ecstasy that she no longer cared about anything except the feel of his dick slamming into her.

Tessa felt an orgasm beginning to build and her muffled moans turned high and tight. His fingers tightened and dug into the tender flesh of her thighs. And when she came, her tight pussy dragged him with her. His entire body spasmed and his hips snapped up as he buried his dick to the hilt inside her pussy. She felt him jerking within her as he sprayed his hot load into the very center of her being. Tessa was glad that she had heeded his warning and taken care of birth control.

Once he was spent, he collapsed against her, their sweat slicked bodies pressed tightly together. Finally, he looked up at her, his dark blue eyes hungrily searching her face.

"Did you cum?" He asked her, even though he already knew the answer.

She tried to say yes but the gag prevented it. Instead, she bobbed her head before she dropped it back down against the door.

"That's a good slut." He praised as he pulled his dick out of her. She felt his spent cum rush down her leg and the absence of him inside her left her feeling empty. "You're not allowed to go back to the party until you come three more times."

She wanted to tell him that it was impossible, but she knew that if anyone could make her cum that many times, was him.

"Let's get started on number two." He purred into her ear as his hand dipped into his pocket once again. When he removed it, he wore a small device on his pointer finger. He pressed a button on its side and a soft hum filled the air. Tessa moaned as she realized what it was. She tossed her head, but he didn't care about her protest. He merely pressed the vibrating finger massager into her clit and set a jolt of pure shock ripping through her. She was still so sensitive from her last orgasm that to have him fondling her clit with a vibrator so soon afterward almost sent her immediately over the edge. Somehow she managed to control herself.

"Trying to fight it, huh?" He murmured as he pressed the massager tighter into her clit and began to rub. "Get it through your head, whore. I own you and I own this pussy. I will make you come any time I want."

Tessa hated it, but she knew it was true. She hadn't needed to come here tonight. He had threatened her with the pictures, but she believed deep down inside that he never would have sent them to her boss. But she had still come because there was a part of her that wanted this. She wanted to be used by this man that she detested. The fact was humiliating enough, but he was more than happy to remind her that she belonged to him now and that sent hot shame flooding through her along with a horrifying flood of pleasure.

Tessa was beginning to grind her hips into his hand once again and he chuckled at her reaction. His pulsing finger began to speed up until her clit felt like it was primed to explode under his touch. And when the second orgasm ripped from her, she threw her head back with a wild scream of pleasure. It was still muffled by the gag, but it was an animalistic sound none the less. She was left panting as she hung from the door, her chest heaving and her breasts thrusting enticingly up in the air.

"Dirty whore." He chuckled as he reached up to slap her breast. Tessa couldn't disagree with him. Only a dirty whore would let him fuck her like this. "Listening to you scream made me hard again."

As he said it, he rubbed the length of his cock along her quivering thigh. She wanted to beg him to stop. She could not take any more of this. But the gag prevented her from protesting. It wouldn't have mattered anyway. Quinn was already lifting her up and freeing her from the hook on the door. Her wrists throbbed painfully as the pressure was relieved and Tessa knew that she was likely to bruise. She was going to have to wear long sleeves to work for a while. Once she was free, she pressed her feet flat on the ground and slumped against the door, but he was not giving her a moment to recover.

"On your hands and knees." He barked at her as he grabbed her by the hair and yanked her to the ground. She hit it hard, and pain flared through her knees. He didn't seem to care. He was already pressing her down by her shoulders until she found her head resting on her folded arms and her red ass sticking straight up in the air for him. He was already behind her, his insistent knees nudging her legs open. Her pussy was spread wide for him and Tessa realized that he had angled her toward the camera so it would have a perfect view. She didn't have time to worry about that. The head of his cock was already pressing into the wet folds of her pussy. He slowly slid the length of his cock into her until he bottomed out. He was maddeningly slow once again as he pulled all the way out of her, before slowly entering her again. Over and over he did this, his movements painstakingly slow and meticulous. And every time he did, she whimpered in protest. She just wanted him to pound into her and make her forget her own name. She moaned into the gag and tried to form words but it muffled the sound before it could leave her.

"What was that?" He chuckled as he listened to her. "Got something to say? Just take off the gag and spit it out."

At his direction she reached behind her and loosened the buckle of the gag. She tossed it distastefully away and licked at her dry lips even as he slid ever so slowly into her once again.

"Please no..." She moaned as she tried to press her hips back into him. "Faster."

"Like this?" He chuckled as if indulging a child as he began to speed up.

"Harder." She moaned past the chattering of her teeth. "Please fuck me harder."

"I love it when you beg." He growled before he took hold of her hips and rammed into her pussy from behind. She cried out at the force of it ... at the utter violence of that thrust. But he did it again, and then again, the thrust of his hips pounding his dick into her already abused pussy. "Is that what you want?!"

"Yes!" She cried out as she began to rock backward to meet every one of his forward thrusts.

"Say it!" He demanded as he grabbed a handful of her hair and jerked her head backward.

"I want you to fuck me hard!" She howled before another thrust sent her teeth rattling. In an instant she recovered. "I want you to pound my pussy."

"That's not your pussy, it's my pussy." He corrected. "Say it!"

"This is your pussy!" She howled. Little zings of electricity were shooting through her body -- starting at her pussy and reaching every cell of her being.

"And you're my whore." He reminded her.

"Yes!" She gasped as that thick dick pounded into her. Her body jerked with every thrust and made her tits bounce the way he liked it.

"Say it." His voice was warning as he gave her hair another firm tug.

"I'm your whore!" She almost felt like crying as she said it.

How had she ended up here? Her pussy being used and stretched as the man that she loathed commanded her body on a whim? She hated Quinn, she could not belong to a man like that. But as quickly as the thought entered her head it was gone. Because he did own her. He could do whatever he wanted to her and her traitorous body would respond in delight. And as the realization hit her, an explosion of pleasure and agony swept through her as her third orgasm ripped through her. He still had ahold of her hair and gave it a mighty yank, pulling her body back onto his cock and fusing them together as tightly as he could as he shot a load of cum deep inside of her for the second time today.

The second that it was over he released her hips and she toppled down into the floor beneath him. She curled in on herself, exhaustion and euphoria both gripping her so completely. She heard him move but did not bother to look up at him. A moment later he was back, and she forced her eyes to crack and glance upward. He stood above her holding his phone, the shutter clicking rapid fire as he went back to taking pictures.

"What would our friends think if they could see you right now?" He asked her as he hunkered down and took a close up shot of her pussy as it oozed him cum onto the carpet beneath her. "What if I sent them all this picture? Would they know it was you? Maybe Jake would." He spoke of her ex-boyfriend so callously. They had ended things on good terms and still remained friends to this day. Tessa knew that Jake would be distressed to see her in a state such as this. "Was he the one you came for?"

"No." Tessa answered the question, her voice an exhausted whisper.

"Good." He nodded as he set the phone aside and nudged her onto her back with his foot.

"Please, no more." She moaned as she tried to scoot away from him.

"You don't get to tell me no." He informed her. "But you're lucky that I want to take a break. But I'm not done with you yet. You owe me one more orgasm before you are allowed to leave."

Tessa moaned and curled into a ball as he stepped over her and headed into the small kitchenette on their right. She heard him rummaging around in the fridge for a moment before he reappeared, slowly sipping a cold bottle of water. He didn't offer her any though, even though she was parched.

"I wish I could take you in there and fuck you in front of them." He informed her. "I would throw you right down on the dinner table and make you scream my name. That's always been my fantasy -- to fuck you while a bunch of people watch. What's your fantasy, whore?"

Tessa went still at that. She didn't want to say this in front of him. But she had a feeling that he already knew.

"Answer me." He commanded.

"This." She finally whispered as a shudder tore through her. "Not with you, but my fantasy has always been this."

To be tied up and used by a domineering man, one that would take whatever he wanted and not give a shit for about her pleasure or needs. One that would punish her for disobedience, pain morphing into pleasure. To be the property of a strong, uncaring man that would own every piece of her down to her very soul.

"You're getting what you want." He said as he took another long swig of his water. "And some day, you're going to make sure I get what I want."

Tessa stilled at his words. Voyeurism did not appeal to her. It was humiliating enough that Quinn got to see her like this but others? The thought was unfathomable.

Several long moments stretched in silence where he studied her thoughtfully. Tessa closed her eyes and bore his scrutiny well. After a moment she heard him finish off the water before he moved back across the room. She heard him fiddling with something and she craned her neck to watch him as he set up the camera on his phone once again. He was preparing for round four. Tessa let out a soft moan and turned her face away from him. He pussy could not take another pounding.

"Stand up." His voice demanded.

For a moment she considered ignoring him but she knew that would not end well for her. So tiredly she rolled onto her side before she pushed herself up onto her knees. Tessa took a deep breath and stood, her legs threatening to buckle beneath her but somehow she was able to force herself to move toward him. She did not stop until she was directly in front of him. Yet that still was not close enough for his liking. He grabbed her cuffed wrists and pulled her forward, guiding her hands down to his cock and wrapping her fingers around him.

"Rub it." He demanded. This Tessa could do. So she wrapped her hands around his dick and began to jerk him off.

"Mmmm." The sound slipped from him as he let his eyes drift shut and ground his hips into her hands.

Tessa was relieved by this turn of events. She did not even attempt to protest as his lips sought out hers and he kissed her hard and deep. Each kiss blended into another as he forced her lips open and plundered her mouth with his tongue. He was moaning into her mouth now as he smashed his lips into hers and ground his hips against her hands. She was convinced that she was close to getting him to cum but just as he began to tremble against her, he pulled abruptly away.

"Didn't think it would be that easy, did ya?" He laughed as he looked down at her startled face. Quickly he spun her around until her back was to him. The next thing she knew he had shoved her down over the arm of the couch. Tessa went with an oomph, the air being driven her lungs as it dug painfully into her stomach. He moved up behind her and kicked her feet apart so she was spread wide open before him. Tessa hoped that he just fucked her fast and got this over with quickly.

"I love seeing your ass red like this." He murmured as he ran his hands over the warm welts. "Honestly ... I just love your ass. It's cute and perky, just like your tits."

As he said it, she felt his hands cease their caress of her flesh as he cupped her cheeks firmly and spread them before him. Tessa froze with the realization of what was happening even as he spoke the horrible words.

"Have you ever been fucked in the ass?"

"No..." Tessa moaned as she tried to squirm away from him. Her coworker from the law firm had once asked her if he could and she had refused. It had just seemed so unappealing to her, not to mention, painful. And that had been a normal sized man. Quinn would tear her apart with his giant cock.

"Good, a virgin hole." He chuckled as she felt something cold and slick being squeezed onto her backside. She could not see what it was, but assumed that it was lube at he and produced from his magical pocket of toys.

"Stop squirming." He warned her as he held her down over the couch with one strong hand pressed firmly into her back. "It will hurt less if you don't fight it."

As he said it he rubbed his slick finger around the rim of her puckered hole before slowly forcing it inside. Tessa cried out at the violation and clamped down around him.

"If you want me to tear up your asshole, keep doing that." He chuckled before he began to move his finger in and out of her.

Tessa took a deep breath and endeavored to relax. He had her pinned and helpless. Time and time again he had shown her that didn't care about her comfort or desires. If this was what he wanted to do to her, there would be no stopping him. Still Tessa felt it as tears squeezed passed her tightly shut eyes as he sawed his finger in and out of her. A second one soon joined it and Tessa let out a small sound of protest at the pain. He said nothing to sooth her, merely continued to move his fingers in and out of her asshole. When he pushed a third finger inside of her, she arched her back and tossed her head in negation.

"Calm down princess." He laughed at her distress. "We haven't even gotten to the main show yet."

Those thick fingers began to move again and he flexed them as he dipped them down into her. Tessa felt her asshole being stretched around those strong fingers. Tessa lost all concept of time as he worked on her. She had no idea how long it had been before he finally pulled his fingers out of her. He did not give her a moment to adjust as he kicked her feet apart as far as they would go and once again used his hands to spread her ass cheeks in front of him. She felt the tip of his penis press into the tight bud before he poured more lube over the length of him. Ever so slowly he began to push inside of her. Her breath was forced from her body as a strangled moan escaped her lips. Pain flared through her ass like a living thing and her flesh was stretched to its limits.

"Stop ... it hurts." She moaned into the couch cushions, but he did not care.

"Shut up and take it." He growled as he continued to force his massive cock into her tight ass. Inch by torturous inch he went until he bottomed out and his balls came to rest against her flesh. "Oh my god, your ass is so tight."

He seemed to take a moment to savor it before he began to move. Her cuffed hands clawed around the couch cushion beneath her face as he began to fuck her ass in earnest. She made no sound ... she was quite incapable of it. All that escaped her locked throat was a long wheeze every time his cock thrust into her.

He began to grunt as he pulsed his hips forward and even though she could not see his face, she imagined that his eyes were closed as he concentrated on the sensations. All she could feel was pain. There was no pleasure for her in this act.

Quinn's body was shaking now and she could tell that he was already fighting an orgasm. She had brought him too close to the edge when she had jerked him off and now the tightness of her ass was pushing him over. He seemed annoyed by the fact. Tessa realized that he had wanted to play with her longer but the sheer tightness of her ass was driving him toward an early orgasm. He gave in and sped up, his balls slapping against her thighs as he pounded her ass. She felt his fingers digging into her hips and knew that she would bear the bruises of them as well.

"Holy shit!" He cried with one final thrust. He buried his entire length in her ass as he shot his load deep into the center of her. His body shook and shivered against her as he savored the sensations.

"I thought I loved your pussy but your ass is my new favorite thing." His voice was gruff when he finally spoke. As he said it, he pulled slowly backward. Tessa moaned and he popped free from her ass and she found herself empty yet again. "You made me cum too fast."

It was said with a slap at one ass cheek. Pain arched through her but she was too exhausted to move away from him.

"No fourth orgasm for you." He informed her as he stared down at her limp body for a moment before grasping her by her shoulders and hauling her upward. He turned her and positioned her on the arm of the couch so she was sitting on it, staring up at his hard face. "I'll let it slide this time since that was new for you but next month if you don't cum with my dick in your ass there will be hell to pay. So you better find a way to relax and enjoy it."

"Next month I'm hosting." Tessa's voice was sluggish.

"So?" The word was annoyed.

"So, if I'm hosting, I can't leave in the middle of a party so you can fuck me." She replied rationally.

"I'll get creative." He shrugged simply as he grabbed her hands and produced a handcuff key out of his pocket. He was already talking again as he began to unlock them from around her wrists.

"Next month, I want the same thing. No bra or panties and a freshly waxed pussy. It felt so nice and smooth when I fucked you today. Buy a new dress. My favorite color is blue. But make sure it shows off your tits."

"Any other demands?" She snorted flippantly.

"Just for you to shut your fucking mouth." He snapped as his hand roughly grabbed her by the nape of her neck and forced her to look up at him. "We're not friends here. I'm not fucking you because I like you. I'm fucking you because I own you, and it's time you started acting like it. You're my property now. That makes you my slave. Do you understand me?"

"Yes." She gasped as she looked up at him in fear. This was the closest that she had seen him come to real anger in a very long time.

"Do you?" He seemed skeptical. "Just to prove that I own you even when we are not here together, I am going to give you homework while we are apart. Do you own a vibrator?" At that she nodded and he smiled brightly down at her, his mood shifting back to normal. "Sometime during the month you are going to make a video of you fucking yourself with your vibrator and you are going to send it to me. I don't care when. Surprise me. Just as long as I have it before our next meeting. And I want to see you cum. You still owe me an orgasm. Understood?"

"Yes." She whispered. At that he smiled. But it was not a smile of pleasure. It was predatory and frightening.

"That's my good little whore. Now get dressed, and get back to the party."

He finally moved out of her way and allowed her to stand up. Tessa made her way over to her red dress and pulled it on over her body. It fit her like a glove and showed every line and curve of her. She found her cell phone and shoes laying forgotten on the floor nearby and she quickly scooped them up before she hurried out of the pool house without another word to him.

Once she was outside, she hurried across the patio and if she was worried he would come flying out of the pool house and grab her and force her back inside. Yet he didn't follow. Tessa slipped back into the house and found her way back to the party, smoothing down her wild hair as she plastered on a bright smile and rejoined her friends at the table. Nothing was amiss. They had barely noticed she was gone. It annoyed her that she had been gone long enough to get her brains fucked out four times and no one had even missed her. She really did have shitty friends. And the shittiest of them all swaggered back into the room not five minutes later and sat back down in his spot without even glancing at her -- as if he just hadn't had his dick buried in her ass. Tessa had to push her annoyance aside and pretend like nothing had happened. Because it if ever got out to their friends that she was letting Quinn fuck her, she would not be able to handle the shame. So she kept her face neutral and the conversation light. She just needed to get through the next hour and she would be able to leave this house and Quinn far behind.

<p align="center">**********</p>

Tessa sat on her big bed, hesitation gripping her. It had been three weeks since the last dinner party and she was only one week away from the next one that she would have to host. And she had not forgotten that Quinn had given her homework. He never reminded her that she owed him a video, but she knew what the consequences would be if she did not comply.

Despite the fact that she had not contacted him at all in the last three weeks, it had not stopped him from sending her multiple pictures of herself, each more humiliating than the last. And they always came at the worst times. The first had been while she was in a staff meeting with the partners. She had looked down at her phone to find a close-up picture of her own cum soaked pussy. Another time she had been out to lunch with a few of her coworkers and her phone had dinged only to find a picture of him with his dick in her ass. More had followed. At least a dozen pictures and short video clips of her getting fucked by him had kept popping up on her phone for the last three weeks. Now the time had come for her to send a video of her own.

Tessa was prepared. She had everything set up just right. There was no more putting it off. She took a deep, steadying breath as she reached forward and pressed the record button on her phone. She had set it up on a tripod that she had bought specially for the occasion.

Tessa sat back on her folded legs and turned her eyes to the camera. She said not a word as she brought her hands to the buttons of her oversized shirt and began to slowly pry them open. All the while she kept her face down but her eyes suggestively turned up to the camera. Finally, the buttons were all open and she shrugged out of her shirt and threw it off to the side. She untied her wrap skirt and tossed it to the floor as well. She was wearing a lacy push up bra and tiny thong panties and she could tell that they were already soaked. She hadn't thought that she would be so turned on by this, but she was.

Tessa trailed her hands all over her exposed skin before she let her fingers dip into her panties. She ran them though her juices before she brought her glistening fingers to her face and began to suck on them, all the while moaning and putting on a show for the camera. Once they were clean, she reached behind her and unhooked her bra. He tits sprung free and she cupped them, kneading and squeezing her tender flesh. She tweaked her own nipples, pulling them hard until they stood out from her breasts like two hard discs. Once her tits were on full display for him, she slid her fingers back into her panties and began to rub her clit. She imagined what he would think while he was watching this. In her mind she imagined his dick growing hard. Would he jerk off to this video? Tessa hoped so.

She took her time, gasping and moaning as she rubbed circles around her clit. Once she was good and primed she pulled her hand out of her panties and hooked her fingers around the delicate lace. Slowly she began to pull them down. Inch by inch her pussy was exposed to the camera. Tessa only shifted so that she could ease them off of her legs. Once she was completely naked she leaned back on her elbows and spread her legs wide for the camera. It was positioned at the foot of the bed but angled down at her so he would not miss a single second of the show.

Tessa let one hand dip down and spread her pussy lips, exposing her to him fully. With her free hand she reached down beside her and picked up her vibrator. A bottle of lube sat beside it, but she wasn't even going to need it. Her pussy was soaked.

Her vibrator was not particularly long but it was thick and had beads beneath the silicone that pulsed inside of her. Tessa turned it on and watched it as it sprang to life. She held it up for the camera to see before she slowly brought it to her pussy. She moved slowly as she guided it inside of her and suddenly wished that it was his big cock instead.

Tessa closed her eyes and imagined him above her, his dick ramming into her as he rutted at her like an animal. Tessa moaned at the image as she began to fuck herself with her vibrator. She moved it within her, her hands quick and firm. As she worked at her pussy she pushed the buttons until her little toy was vibrating at its highest speed. Tessa moaned and squirmed as her pussy gushed her juices down into the sheets below. She was not gentle with herself, because he was never that way and would want to see her fuck herself as roughly as he did. So she rammed the vibrator into her pussy, her cries becoming more high and frantic with each moment that passed. And when she found herself on the edge or orgasm she reached up and gave one nipple such a firm pinch that it sent pain flaring through her ... but that was exactly what she wanted.

Tessa threw her head back with a scream as an orgasm tore through her. Her toes curled and her back arched as her pussy grabbed ahold of the vibrator and held it securely inside of her.

Once she was spent, she fell back down to the bed, her body shaking as the delicious aftereffects of the orgasm ripped through her. She let herself lay just like that for a moment, her vibrator still humming merrily inside her spent pussy, before she slowly slid it out of her.

Tessa ever so slowly pushed herself up, her chest heaving and her body glistening with sweat. Once she was kneeling on the bed in front of the camera once again she lifted the vibrator to her lips and pressed a kiss into its tip before she offered the camera one last coy smile and ended the recording.

Tessa took a few moments to compose herself before she slid from her bed and pulled a silky robe on. She washed her hands and the vibrator before she turned her attention to her phone. Part of her wanted to watch the video that she had just made but she didn't dare. She didn't want to see herself that way. Besides, she had a feeling that he was just going to pull video stills from it anyway and send them to her over the course of the coming week. Instead, she simply sent the video to him.

Once it was on its way, she felt the tension leave her body. No matter what happened now, she had done what she was told. At least he would not take it out of her ass next week. Tessa wondered if he would tell her once he watched it. She would never know if he did, unless he chose to tell her about it.

Tessa attempted to go about her evening just as she normally would. She made herself a quick dinner and afterward, settled into her office with copies of briefs scattered before her. She still had a lot of work to do tonight. But she was just getting settled in when she heard her phone ding. Her breath froze within her. Was it him?

But it could have been anyone. Work, one of her friends ... hell, even spam. She was going to have to assign him his own text tone so she would know when it was him. For now, her fingers shook as she scooped up the phone. She was rewarded with a new text from Quinn, along with a photo attachment.

<strong>Look what you did to me.</strong>

Tessa quickly opened the attachment and found a picture of his dick. It was rock hard, one of his hands wrapped around it and a little bubble of cum on its tip. For the first time since he had started sending her dirty pictures, she did not erase this one. And in another first, she responded to his message.

<strong>Did you enjoy the show?</strong>

<strong>Yes I did, dirty slut. Were you thinking of me when you rammed that vibrator in your pussy?</strong>

<strong>Yes.</strong> Was her simple response. Why bother lying to him? A long beat passed before his response popped up on her phone.

<strong>The next time I see you, I'm going to fuck you so hard that you won't walk right for a week.</strong>

<strong>Is that a promise, or a threat?</strong> She asked him with a grin.

<strong>Both.</strong>

<strong>Good.</strong> Was all she said before she switched her phone to silent and got back to work. Still, she could feel her pussy dripped into the leggings that she was currently wearing. Her mind kept conjuring images of him punishing her pussy for her teasing him. She only hoped that reality lived up to her imagination.

It was the night of their next dinner party, and all of her friends were gathered at Tessa's penthouse. The night was clear and beautiful and it offered them all a spectacular view of the city below. Tessa had served them a delicious catered meal, as she did not cook herself, and they had enjoyed a leisurely dessert and torn through multiple bottles of wine. She was currently fetching more from the pantry and was straining to reach a few bottles of red that she kept up on a high shelf when she heard a small sound behind her. She looked behind her to find Quinn slipping into the pantry, shutting the door behind him.

He hadn't said a single word to her all night, but his eyes spoke for him whenever he looked at her. He seemed especially appreciative of her new royal blue dress. It had a deep v-neck collar that showed off her tits, the raunched fabric held up by thin gold chains that functioned as straps. It was backless and tight around her body, the skirt high and body contouring.

"What are you doing?" She demanded, the wine forgotten.

"Shut up." Was all he rumbled as he grabbed her by her shoulders and shoved her face against the wall. His hands were immediately at her waist, pulling her skirt up to expose her naked pussy to him. "Already wet for me, you whore."

He had already unzipped his pants and before she even knew what was happening, he had lifted her up by her waist and rammed him dick up inside her.

"We don't have much time." He grunted as he began to fuck her, his strokes long and hard. His massive weight was pinning her up on the wall and holding her immobile as he fucked her from behind. He was rough and needy, his dick as hard as a rock inside of her. Her body was coming alive and she let her head roll back onto his shoulder as she focused on the sensations within her. Over and over he pounded her, her breath rattling out of her and her tits jiggling with every thrust. Her pussy began to throb and she knew that she was nearing orgasm.

"Quiet!" He snarled as one meaty hand pressed over mouth to stifle the moans that were beginning to rattle out of her. "If they hear us, they will come and there is no lock on that door. Do you want that?"

She moaned and tossed her head at his words. No, she didn't want that but the agony and ecstasy within her was growing with every second that he pounded into her. Thankfully he kept his hand over her mouth so when the orgasm gripped her, her shrill scream was muffled by the flesh of his hand.

"Your pussy is dripping for me." His breath rattled out of him as he nipped at her ear. "Dirty, whore. You like getting fucked like this, don't you?"

"Yes." She tried to moan into his thick hand. It was muffled, but still he understood.

"Hiding in a closet getting fucked from behind." He chuckled as he reached up to pull her hair. He yanked on it with every thrust of his hips. He was speeding up again, if such a thing was possible. She did not know how it was possible for him to keep up this pace but he did, his dick ramming relentlessly into her tight pussy. A moment later he came with a groan, his entire body going tense as his dick sprayed its hot load into her.

Once it was over he pulled his dick out of her with moan. Still he kept her pinned to the wall, his large body hard against her.

"I didn't plan that, but I saw you come in here and I couldn't wait." He informed her. His hand was still over her mouth so she could not speak but she wanted to ask him: wait for what? "You've been teasing me with that dress all night. I just needed to shove my dick in you."

With that he finally released her and stepped backward. Tessa took a deep breath as she pulled her skirt back down and covered herself up. Finally, she turned to face him and found him smirking at her. He studied her for a moment before he reached for the two bottles of wine that she had been reaching for and pressed them into her hands.

"We better get back to the party." He informed her. "But tonight, after everyone leaves, I want you to take your trash out to the dumpster on the first floor of the parking garage. Do you understand?"

Tessa nodded soundlessly. Her mind was already whirring. Did he plan on fucking her behind the dumpster like a street person? But she didn't question him.

"Good whore." He nodded as he turned her by her shoulders and gave her a shove toward the door. Tessa opened it and slipped back into her kitchen before making her way into the dining room and holding up the wine.

"Who needs a refill?" She called as she held up the bottles -- just as if this was any normal dinner. As if Quinn had not just fucked her against the wall in her own pantry with all of her friends so close by. Any one of them could have walked in and found her with his dick buried in her pussy. Tessa knew that Quinn would have loved that.

The devil himself slipped back into the room a few minutes later and went back to his usual routine of completely ignoring her.

Bastard.

Tessa turned her contemptuous eyes on him and tried to make him feel her hate for him. He glanced up and smirked at her, but those blue eyes held a promise of things to come. She felt a sharp jolt tear through her clit and she shifted uncomfortably in her seat. He chuckled before he turned his attention back to the person beside him and tuned her out once again.

God, how she hated him.

<p align="center">**********</p>

Over an hour later, Tessa found herself riding the elevator down to the parking garage, a bag of trash clutched in her hand. She felt ridiculous doing this in her blue dress but she had dared not change out of it after the party. She had a feeling that it would piss Quinn off.

There were trash chutes upstairs so there was no reason for her to be doing this. The dumpster was only for items too large to fit in the chutes. But she was complying. She knew the consequences if she didn't.

Finally the elevator dinged and the door slid open. Cautiously she made her way into the garage. It was full of cars this late at night, but she saw no people. She wondered if Quinn was watching her from one of the vehicles. She had no idea what kind of car he even drove.

Tessa made her way across the quiet, dark garage, jumping at every little noise that she heard. Once she reached the dumpster she threw her trash bag over the rim before looking nervously around.

Now what?

He had only told her to come, not what would happen once she got here. Tessa stood motionless for one endless moment before she decided that this was dangerous to be standing in a dark parking garage in the middle of the night. She had just resolved to go back upstairs when a small sound behind her made her jump. The next thing she knew, a form slammed into her from behind and pulled her backward into a broad chest. A meaty hand covered her mouth and Tessa instantly began to struggle.

"Calm down." A familiar voice rumbled next to her ear. The fear left her, quickly being replaced with anger as Quinn manhandled her toward a large luxury SUV. She thought he was going to force her inside of it but instead he dragged her toward the little red sports car parked beside it. Before she knew what was happening he had shoved her down and bent her over the hood.

"No, not here!" She gasped as she tried to push herself up but his massive weight was pinning her down, just like it had that first time in the bathroom.

"Worried one of your neighbors might see?" He chuckled as he started to pull her skirt up. "Because that might actually happen."

And with that he entered her. Tessa cried out as his dick plunged into her pussy and found herself being fucked from behind for a second time tonight. But this time was so much different that the first. At least they had the cover of the pantry that first time. This time, there was nothing. The SUV beside them blocked most of the garage's view but all anyone had to do was walk passed and they would see her getting fucked.

The way that she was draped across the hood had made her feet leave the ground so she dangled there as he used her pussy. Her hands were still flat on the hood of the sports car as she continued to attempt to push herself up but it was no use. It was like pushing against a solid brick wall.

"Just enjoy it whore." Quinn snarled as he grabbed a fistful of her hair and forced her head up. She had been trying to twist it toward the wall on her left so at least no one could see her face if they happened to walk by but he wasn't letting her have even that small sliver of dignity. He merely twisted her neck back to face the garage and he continued to fuck her hard. Tessa squeezed her eyes shut and tried to listen for any sounds out in the garage but all she heard were his grunts and the sounds of the metal of the hood groaning every time he slammed into her. It seemed to take forever before he came, his body straining above her he tried to dive as deep as he could go. Once he was spent he hung above her, his dick slowly sliding from her pussy and sending cum splattering down the side of the red sports car.

"Oops." Quinn chuckled as he looked down at it. "I wonder if the poor dude is going to have any idea what we did on his car?"

Tessa had no reply. He had straightened and began to stuff his cock back into his pants and now that his weight was off of her she was able to slide down the side of the car and pull her dress back down to cover herself. She kept her head down as she began inch away from him and head back toward the elevator.

"Where do you think you're going?" He asked, his voice low but warning as his hand shot out to grip her arm. "I'm not done with you."

With that he gave her a yank and pulled her toward the SUV beside them. He shoved her inside and she was quick to realized that this was his car. She found herself in the plush back seat and he climbed in behind her before locking the door after them.

Was he going to take her somewhere, or simply fuck her in the back seat? At least the windows were heavily tinted so there was some privacy. But people would still be able to see their silhouettes and hear the sounds that they made. If anyone came closer to investigate they might be able to peer through the windows and see them.

"Please, can we just go upstairs to my place?" She was quick to negotiate.

"No." Was all he said as he grabbed her ankle and dragged her toward him. Her skirt was hiked up in the process and exposed her pussy to him once again. There was a hungry glimmer in his eyes as he stared down at it. They were wild and possessive.

"Please Quinn ... let's just go upstairs. I'll be so good to you!" She promised.

"Well, that's no fun." He chuckled as he settled before her and held her down. He was reaching for something and produced a fabric bag from behind the seat. Obviously he had brought more toys from home this time. He fished around inside and pulled out the largest vibrator that she had ever seen.

"You didn't enjoy yourself when I fucked you on the car so you're going to cum for me now. And I want to hear you scream." He informed her as he turned it on and showed it to her. It almost seemed to pulsate in his hand. And not only did it vibrate but the tip swung in lazy circles and the thought of it doing the same inside of her sent her heat pooling in her belly. "Your vibrator was nice but I know your pussy can handle more."

As he said it he guided it to her legs and began to push it inside of her. Tessa's back arched as it filled her up and began to pulse inside of her. Quinn laid above her and moved it, his hands rough as he shoved it in and out of her. It was almost as large as him but felt so much different.

"You like that, don't you?" He asked as he fucked her with the vibrator.

" Yes..." She whimpered past her chattering teeth.

"Such a dirty whore." Quinn whispered as he lowered his face to her breasts and began to suck. Her nipple went hard in his mouth, but the moment she felt sweet tingles of pleasure race through her he bit down on the tender flesh of her breast. Tessa's eyes flew open with a cry of pain as she looked down at him in shock. He ignored her and went to work on her other breast. He nipped and bit, sucked and licked, all the while moving the vibrator in and out of her. She didn't even care that her breasts now bore several bite marks each. They had all sent a jolt of pleasure straight to her pussy.

"Oh god... she moaned when she realized that he was about to make her cum. Her head was thrown backward against the seat as her breasts heaved, her entire body squirming from the force she could feel building within her. And when it exploded, it knocked all sanity and sense from her. Tessa threw her head back and howled. When she finally came down from the orgasm high, she looked back up to find him studying her intently.

"You really love this, don't you?" He asked as he ran his eyes over her flushed face. She hated that he was forcing her to admit her private shame, but she still nodded at his words. "Why?"

"I guess we're all fuck up." Was all she could think to say. He thought about that for a moment before he laughed.

"Ever since high school, I thought you were some uptight cunt with a stick up your ass. I wish I had known sooner what a slut you are. We could have been fucking this whole time."

"In your dreams, asshole." She growled as she tried to push him off of her.

"I love your mouth, but I hate your voice." He informed her before he shoved the vibrator into her mouth. "Clean it up."

She sighed but did as he instructed, licking her own juices off of the vibrator that was still turning and pulsing in her mouth. He forced it to the back of her throat before he pulled it back out, repeating the movement until she gagged.

"That's enough of that." He said as he switched the vibrator off and tossed it to the side. "You need a real dick in your mouth. On your knees, bitch."

He sat quickly up and pulled her with him. His hand was in her hair and he yanked her off the seat and forced her to her knees in front of him. He guided her hands to the zipper of his pants and forced her fingers around the metal pull. Tessa knew what he wanted and needed no further prompting. She unzipped his pants and pulled him free from his underwear. He sprang out toward her and there was no hesitation this time as she took him into her mouth with a sigh. Immediately she began to suck with a fervor that seemed to surprise him.

"Jesus Christ girl ..." He moaned as his head rolled back to rest on seat behind him. "Did you miss my cock or something?"

She pulled her mouth off of him for a one moment, just long to moan four small words. "You taste so good."

Then she was sucking him again. The wet slurping sounds of her mouth on his cock filled the car. He groaned as his hands found their way to her hair and balled through the thick strands. He started pushing her down -- it was unnecessary with the vigor that she was sucking him -- but she supposed that he liked to have control.

Tessa loosened her throat and tried to take as much as possible. This time was slightly easier than the last time. Maybe every time she gave him head it would get easier and easier until someday she would be able to deep throat his massive cock with ease. She reached up to cup his balls as she lapped along his dick, her fingers firm yet gentle as she stroked and teased him. Every once in a while she would moan so that the vibrations would travel through her throat and wash over his cock. Every time that she did, she would feel him gasp and stiffen.

Soon his hips began to snap up and meet her mouth. Her lips were stretched tightly around his dick but she still clenched them as hard as she could as she sucked. Finally she felt the balls in the palm of her hand give a mighty jerk before he sprayed himself into her mouth. Tessa tasted his saltiness as she swallowed, gulping down his cum and making sure that not a drop spilled this time. Then she licked along the length of him and cleaned him up before she lifted her eyes to him. She found his entire body boneless as he stared up at the roof of the car, his chest heaving as he panted.

"I think you just sucked my soul out through my dick." He informed her as he finally lifted his head to look at her. "I need a break."

She began to move at his words so she could sit on the seat but his rough hands pushed her back down to the floor.

"You stay there." He growled as guided her head down to his lap so it was laying beside his limp dick. His warm, sticky flesh was nestled against her cheek. His hand was in her hair but it was not a soothing gesture. Instead he balled his fingers around it to make sure she didn't move. "You can rest there with my dick in your face. Once I get hard again I want you to suck me off again. We're going to do this as many times as it takes for me to get bored with your mouth. We've got all night, princess."

Tessa shivered at his words, because he was right. This was not a quick screw session in one of their friend's houses before they had to get back to the party. The dinner was over and all of their friends had gone home. It was the middle of the night and he could keep her here for hours if he wanted to, using her mouth over and over for as long as it pleased him.

Her pussy quivered in frustration. She wanted to fuck, not suck on him all night. But he was in control and there was no fighting his whims.

Tessa was not sure how long she sat there but her eyes were beginning to grow heavy. Would he get mad at her if she fell asleep? But just as the thought entered her mind, she felt a sharp tug on her hair. She blinked her eyes and found that his dick was starting grow hard next to her face.

"Get to work." He rumbled as he gave her head a rough shake. Tessa complied and took him into her mouth once again. This time he was fresh and rested and it took a lot of sucking to make him come. Yet eventually he did, his hands holding either side of her face and forcing her down against his pubic bone.

"Good bitch." Was all he said as he forced her to lay her head in his lap once again and nuzzle his limp dick.

Tessa lost track of time there in the dark, quiet car. A few times she heard people coming and going in the garage behind their little private bubble, but no one ever seemed to notice that they were there, or the wild sex that was going on just behind a thin pane of tinted glass.

Tessa was soon recovering from her third time giving him head, her head once again resting in his lap, when she felt his dick growing hard yet again. She lifted her head with a sigh and opened her mouth but this time he caught her by the chin and forced her to stop.

"We're done with that." He informed her as he guided her to draw herself up and kneel before him. He was studying her now, his eyes running over her hungrily. His hands reached for her dress that she had managed to keep on through all of this, but he quickly tugged it up over her head. Now she knelt before him naked and exposed. His dick was still sticking out of his pants, but other than that he was completely clothed. It was yet another way he liked to show her that he was in charge.

After a moment of silent study Quinn reached forward to cup one breast. His hands were rough and calloused. She had heard that he was into rock climbing, among other physical hobbies. They kept him fit so that he was the same wall of muscle that she had known since high school.

His rough hand fondled her breast before he rolled the nipple between his fingers and gave it a hard pinch. Tessa flinched but did not cry out. He pulled and pinched both nipples before a hard slap landed against one sensitive breast. Tessa gasped, but not from pain. Her pussy roared to life and her clit throbbed from the treatment.

"You really love this." He observed as he slapped her across the breasts again before he pinched her nipple as hard as he could. Two hands cupped her breasts and she leaned forward into their warmth as they began to massage her skin. He increased the pressure until he was kneading them, pausing to alternate between slaps and pinches.

"What other kind of pain do you like?" He asked before he landed a slap across her face. Tessa's eyes widened in shock, but she did not cry out. He hadn't hit her very hard, just enough to surprise her. He didn't mind leaving marks all over her body but she knew that he probably drew the line a messing up her face.

"Did you like that?" He asked. Tessa felt humiliated tears building in her eyes as she gave him a tight nod yes. Quinn chuckled at her reaction before he slapped the other side of her face. Tessa gasped as her tears spilled down her cheeks. What the fuck was the matter with her? What could make a person enjoy such treatment at the hands of someone they hated?

"God, you're hot when you're crying.". He growled. "Get up here."

With that his hands gripped her shoulders and yanked her up into his lap. When she settled, she found herself straddling him. His hard dick was trapped between their bodies but he seemed unconcerned with pursuing a release at the moment. Instead, he reached behind her and slapped her ass. She closed her eyes and moaned at the sting of it. He chuckled at her reaction before he did it again. He was alternating slaps with firm rubs until the skin of her ass was warm and humming.

"Ride my dick." He commanded after a moment.

Tessa rested her hands on his shoulders to steady herself as she lifted her hips and slowly lowered herself down onto his dick. With the weight of her body pressing her down onto it he felt twice as huge as usual. Tessa adjusted to the feel of it as she began rock.

"Faster." He directed as he slapped her ass, this time much harder than before. Tessa whimpered but complied, her trim hip speeding up as she rode him.

"Make those tits bounce, bitch." He commanded as he slapped her breasts. Tessa tried to put a bounce into her movements as she moved up and down on his dick. He seemed satisfied for the moment and watched the way her tits moved while she rode him. Tessa moaned and threw her head back, shoving her tits into his face. She felt the hard bite of his teeth before he did something unexpected. She felt one large hand wrap around the front of her throat and squeeze. He was not cutting off her air completely but it was enough to cause panic as he choked her.

"Don't you dare stop." He growled as he released her throat and gave her face a warning smack. Then his hand shifted back to her throat once again. Tessa could not keep track of his hands anymore. All she knew was that her body was bouncing between pleasure and pain and she was lost to it all.

"You don't cum until I tell you to." He commanded in her ear as he gave her throat another squeeze.

"But I can't control it." She moaned once she could breathe again.

"You better fucking figure it out." He snarled with another firm squeeze of her throat. "You'll be punished if you don't."

"Please..." Tears burst forth once again. Yet she never stopped ridding him. His dick felt like a hot metal pole inside of her, scraping her raw as pain made all of her senses come alive and shoot pleasure straight to her clit.

"It's too much...." She moaned as she felt the fire growing between her legs.

"I said no." He warned her. But it was impossible and he knew it. He was setting her up for another failure just so he could punish her. He could tell her at any time to cum and she would happily comply but she knew that no matter what, he would never give her permission. And when she failed, he would gleefully exact his punishment.

"Bastard." It came out as a groan as she bounced in his lap.

"I might be a bastard, but you let me fuck you. What does that say about you, little whore?" He taunted as he tightened his hand around her throat. The fire in her clit exploded like a supernova the moment her air was cut off. Tessa threw her head back and tried to scream as she came on his dick but his hand was still tight around her throat. Even as she did, he exploded inside of her, hot cum shooting like a rocket from his dick and spraying her insides. The moment the orgasm was over he released her throat and she collapsed against him, spent. They both sat limply for several long minutes, their bodies locked together, before she felt him move. He lifted her up and off of him as if she weighed nothing and tossed her down onto the seat beside him.

"You came without permission. I warned you what would happen if you did." He informed her as he began rummaging around in his bag.

"That wasn't fair." She protested. "There wasn't any way that I could do what you said and you know it."

"Not my problem." He shrugged as he forced her arms behind her. Tessa felt cuffs snap around them before he fitted a gag into her mouth. She moaned as he pulled her down over his lap with her hands bound behind her and her ass in the air. Tessa was horrified that he was going to spank her like a child. But when the first blow landed across her ass it was not delivered by his hand. She cried out as much as the gag would allow and tried to look behind her. She was just in time to see him raise a paddle into the air before he brought it down on her ass with a resounding thwack. Tesse stiffened and cried out, her whole body trying to wiggle out of his lap. But he easily held her there as he paddled her ass. He took his time, pausing between each heavy blow so her mind could register the pain. By the time he finished, both of her ass cheeks were bright red and she was crying once again but whether it was from pain or a mix of pleasure and frustration she couldn't tell anymore.

"I'm not done with that ass." He informed her as he eased her out of his lap and bent her over the back of the seat. Tessa lay there raggedly, every cell in her body zinging and hypersensitive. On some level she already knew what he meant to do before he even started, but she still jumped when she felt his hands spread her ass cheeks. A moment later, lube was squirted onto her before he began to work her with his fingers.

"Remember what I said last time." He warned her as he loosened her. Tessa moaned into the gag at the memory. He had threatened to punish her if she didn't cum when he took her ass. He had already punished her once today. She didn't think that she could stand any more. So she took a deep breath and tried to lose the tension from her body.

He worked silently, his fingers prodding and loosening her for his giant cock. Finally they withdrew and she felt more lube being applied before his cock nestled between her ass cheeks. He was rubbing it there, letting her ass lube him up before he fucked her. When he shifted and pressed the head of his cock into her asshole, Tessa took a deep breath and released it as she felt him begin to slide into her. She had been reading on the internet the best ways to take a dick in the ass and that had been one suggestion. It seemed to help and he slid into her with a groan. Once again she felt that it was difficult to breathe as he began to pump inside of her. Still Tessa loosened her body and tried to grant him unimpeded access. As he moved, he reached around and fingered her clit. Tessa moaned and attempted to move her hips to meet him.

"That's a good whore." He laughed at her reaction. "You're starting to like this."

Tessa found that he was right. Between working her clit and the strange fullness in her ass, it was starting to awaken something new. And when he shifted and hit that hidden g spot deep down inside her ass, she threw her head back with a wild cry.

"Oh princess..." he moaned in return as his hands found her hips and used them for leverage. He was quickening his pace now that he could tell that she was able to withstand it and not tear apart. Soon he was grinding into her ass with abandon. Primal grunts escaped him with every thrust. Tessa felt an orgasm building and it took her quite by surprise when it hit her. Every muscle in her body locked, her ass tightening around his dick and pulling him into her.

"That's a good girl." He groaned with a slap at her ass as he continued to fuck her. He hadn't cum yet, and wasn't going to stop until he did. As her muscles slowly began to unlock he began to quicken his pace once again. Tessa was spent and just laid still and let him take her. But then above the moans and the grunts and the slap of their skin, a new sound invaded her consciousness.

The elevator doors had just opened up not far from them and now there was the murmur of voices and footsteps. Panic gripped her. Could they see them? Could they hear?

"Dude, I think people are having sex in that car!" A voice exclaimed. Tessa jerked in horror but Quinn merely laughed and continued to fuck her in the ass.

"Too late now." He murmured as he tightened his hands around her hips and continued to slam into her.

"They are!" Another voice returned. They sounded young, a group of men in their very late teens or early twenties. College students, perhaps. Tess heard three distinct voices as they tried to peer into the car. Everything except the windshield was tinted so at least they would not be able to clearly see in. But Quinn seemed to be spurred on by the audience.

"I'm fucking this bitch in her ass!" He yelled to the young men outside. A group cheer answered his words. Tessa moaned into her gag and dropped her head, letting her long hair fall into her face so if they someone did get a peek they wouldn't be able to tell who she was.

"Let us see!" One of the voices called back.

"Should I roll down the window?" Quinn asked, each of the words bitten off and grunted.

"Nnnn..." Tessa sobbed into her gag. She needn't have worried. Knowing there was an audience, no matter how limited, was enough to push him over the edge. Quinn slammed into her with a roar one last time, releasing his load into her ass. He settled above her, his muscles quivering and his breath rattling in and out of him. He stayed buried in her ass, enjoying the orgasm as the voices outside the car complained when they realized the main event was over. After a moment he pulled out of her, both of them groaning as her ass released his penis with a satisfying sound. But even once he was out of her he continued to move and too late did Tessa realize that he was reached for the window. She tried to scream for him to stop but all that slipped passed the gag was a strangled cry. Quinn ignored her and pressed the button. Tessa turned her face away, even though she was hanging over the back of the seat and it was already hidden from them. Humiliation flooded her as the window opened and revealed her raw ass pointing up in the air to those outside the car.

"Holy shit." One of the young men gasped. His voice was clearer now that there was no window between them.

"Sorry, couldn't stop to let you watch." Quinn shrugged as he gave her ass another slap. "But I thought you might appreciate the view."

"She likes that?" One of the guys asked. She could only assume how it looked, her red, beaten ass sticking straight up in the air and her hands cuffed behind her back.

"Bitch loves it, don't you?" Quinn replied as he stuck two fingers in her glistening pussy and began to rub her clit. A strangled moan was her only response but she could not stop herself from pressing back into him.

"Who is she?" One of them asked. Tessa's heart sped up at the question but Quinn merely glazed over it.

"Just some chick I know." Quinn replied as he finally pulled his fingers out of her. He probably knew that telling them who she was would be taking it too far. If it happened, she would stop letting him fuck her and no matter how he felt about her personally, he craved her pussy.

"Can we fuck her too?" Once of the guys asked hopefully.

"Nope, she belongs to me." Quinn's voice turned hard for a moment before reverting back to his previous jovial tone. "But you can take a picture to remember her by."

Tessa tossed her head and flexed her fingers but Quinn merely slapped her ass again and told her to be quiet. Tessa settled as there was a chatter of voices before the young men started pulling out their cell phones.

"Stick your fingers in her again." One of them bade Quinn. He seemed happy to oblige and shoved two fingers into her pussy. Tessa moaned as he finger fucked her in front of these strangers, his thumb beginning to rub rough circles around her clit as he worked.

"She looks so wet." Another observed. Tessa could not hear the click of cell phone cameras and could only imagine that they were recording her humiliation. Would pictures of her pussy end up online tonight? Or the video on some amateur porn site with the tag "slut gets finger banged in a car in front of strangers"? Heat rushed to her face, but it could not compare to the heat rushing to her pussy.

"This pussy is like a slip and slide." Quinn informed them. His fingers made wet sounds as he began to move them faster. Tessa moaned and began to wiggle her hips in an attempt to thrust back into him. "She just got fucked in the ass and she still wants it in the pussy."

The men were all laughing as they watched Quinn work. Every once in a while he would slap her ass as he rubbed at her and every time it elicited a startled cry of pleasure. Soon she was coming yet again, Tessa screaming into the gag as her pussy gushed its juices around Quinn's fingers.

"Jesus ... I've got a hard on now." One of the men complained.

"Can't help you there." Quinn laughed at his predicament. "Sorry fellas, show's over. I've got shit to do."

There was a round of protests but Quinn was already putting the window back up. Once it was all the way closed, Tessa dared to peek up over the seat. She could see three young men standing beside the car with cell phones in their hands, all calling for Quinn to open the window again. Quinn just ignored them as he grabbed her by her shoulders and hauled her up.

"That was fun." He chuckled by her ear. "If they had just been ten minutes earlier, I would have let them watch me fuck you. Would you have liked that?"

Tessa tossed her head but he merely laughed at her response.

"Liar." He purred as he cupped her breasts and squeezed them. "You came on my fingers pretty hard with them watching. You liked it. Admit it."

Maybe she had, just a little. Perhaps because she knew that her face had been hidden from them and there was no way that they could identify her. But letting them watch her, bound and helpless as Quinn abused her pussy, it had been a turn on that she had not been expecting. Outside the car the men were beginning to reluctantly filter away when it became apparent that Quinn was not going to open the window again. Tessa watched them go in relief.

"Next time we have an audience, they are going to watch it all." Quinn informed her as he made himself comfortable there in the back seat and pulled her down into his lap. But he was not holding her sweetly like a boyfriend would. Instead, it was a possessive embrace. Like an animal guarding a piece of meat. He unhooked her gag and tossed it away but left her hands bound behind her. He sat in silence and seemed to slip deep into thought. Still, he fondled her breasts almost absently. For her part, Tessa laid limply against him. Her muscles ached and every single one of her holes hurt.

"Do you have a boyfriend?" He asked her suddenly.

"Do you think I would be fucking you if I did?" She returned. She knew that she was running the risk of pissing him off but she didn't care.

"If you wanted my dick bad enough." He said. "Answer the fucking question."

"No." She snapped back in annoyance.

"Anyone else you're fucking?"

Tessa sighed and considered the question. She didn't feel like she owed him any details about her personal life, but she decided to answer him anyway.

"There's a guy I work with. We hook up sometimes."

"That stops now." He rumbled as his arms locked painfully tight around her.

"You can't tell me what to do in my free time. Or who to do."

"The hell I can't." He snarled as his hand drifted up to her neck and gave it a squeeze. Tessa gasped and went still as she tried to regulate her breathing. "You're my toy, and I don't share. No one fucks you anymore except for me. Got it?"

"Quinn..."

"Got it?!" His voice was rough and angry now.

"Yes." She gasped and was rewarded by the pressure on her throat releasing.

"Good girl." He sounded satisfied as he gave her bare thigh a slap before he snapped her body forward and exposed her arms to him. Quickly he pulled the cuffs off of her before he pushed her out of his lap and sent her tumbling to the floor. "Get dressed. I'm done with you."

Tessa complied, her throbbing body moving stiffly as she reached for her dress. She struggled to pull it on over her trembling body but soon it was wrapped tightly back around her.

"Take this." He said as he shoved a box into her hands. It was about the size of a shoebox and she could tell that there was something inside of it. But the box was completely black and tightly sealed. "Do not open it until I tell you to. I'm going to call you at some point and you better answer. Don't worry, I'll do it on a weekend so I won't bother you at your precious job. Just have that box ready to go when I call."

Tessa nodded as she hugged the box to her chest and cast a worried glance outside the car window.

"Don't worry, they're gone." He said as if reading her thoughts. "I saw them get into a car and drive away. But I'll wait until you get into the elevator. I don't want anyone messing with my personal fuck toy. Now get the hell out of my car."

Tessa didn't have to be told twice. Quickly she slid toward the door and let herself outside. He slammed it shut behind her and Tessa began to make her way toward the elevator. It seemed to take forever to make its way down to her but finally it dinged and she slipped inside without incident. She pressed the button and entered her personal access code for her restricted floor before the doors slid shut and she began to move. The elevator made no stops when it was heading for a penthouse floor so thankfully she didn't have to deal with other passengers getting on with her. Even though she lived at the top it took very little time to reach there. Tessa made her way to her home and let herself inside with a sigh of relief.

The kitchen and dining room were a still a mess from the dinner party but she had no desire to clean it up. Normally she took care of the cleaning herself but she decided that she would probably just hire a maid service to deal with it for her tomorrow. Right now, all she wanted was a hot shower and to pass out for about ten hours. Thankfully their dinner parties were always held on Friday nights so there would be no work in the morning for her to worry about.

Tessa made her way into her room and over to her dresser to get something clean and comfortable to wear after her shower. She pulled out her oldest, most broken in pair or pajamas before moving on to her underwear drawer only to stop with a gasp when she pulled it open. It was completely empty. All save for a folded piece of white paper. Tessa scooped it up and opened it, her heart beat speeding up in anger at the short message it contained.

<em>Whores don't deserve panties.</em>

"Damn him." Tessa snarled as she crushed the note in her trembling fingers. How the hell had he managed to get every pair of underwear that she owned out of the apartment without anyone noticing?

She was not upset about the monetary value of the panties, even though some of them had been very expensive. They could be easily replaced. It was the fact that he had come into her bedroom and looked through her private belongings, and that he was arrogant enough to take what he wanted.

Then again, he always took what he wanted, including her.

Tessa slammed the drawer back shut and gave up. She was just going to have to go without until she could go shopping and replace them. It didn't change her current needs. So Tessa put Quinn out of her mind as she shuffled off to the shower, intent to wash the smell of sex off of her.

Tessa laid curled on her couch with a fluffy blanket spread over her and movie on TV. It was her second weekend at home since the night of the dinner party that she had hosted. Last weekend she had not dared leave her apartment and today was the same. Quinn had told her to be ready for his phone call and she was worried what would happen if she was out and about when the phone rang. She knew that he was going to want her to do something with whatever was in the box and she needed the privacy of her apartment to do so. So for a second weekend in a row she had been a home body. Not that she minded. There were very few people that she liked to socialize with anyway outside of the monthly dinner parties.

Tessa had managed to make it halfway through the movie when her phone rang beside her and made her jump. She had assigned Quinn his own text and ring tones so she automatically knew that it was him. But when she lifted the phone, she was surprised to see an incoming video call. She felt her heart rate begin to speed up and her finger shook slightly as she pressed the button to answer it. Immediately his face popped into view.

"There's my fuck toy." His grin was predatory as he leaned toward the camera and seemed to study her through the view screen. "You look hot. No bra. Is that for me?"

"I never wear a bra at home." She replied as she glanced down at her body. She was wearing a form fitting tank top and comfortable pair of cotton shorts. Afterall, she was just relaxing and watching movies and she had wanted to be comfortable.

"What about panties?" He asked with an evil grin.

"I replaced the ones you stole." She informed him with a scowl.

"That's a shame. Where's the box I gave you?"

"Here." She replied as grabbed it off the coffee table and held it up to the camera.

"Take the box and your phone to the bedroom." He instructed. Tessa didn't argue. She merely gathered up the items and headed for her bedroom. "Lights all the way on and set your phone up on the tripod I saw in there."

Tessa gritted her teeth at the reminder that he had roamed around her room and looked at her things when he had been here for the dinner party. Still, she did as instructed, following his directions so the tripod was set up where he wanted it. When it was done, it was positioned near her floor to ceiling mirror, angled ever so slightly downward.

"Now stand in front of the phone and take off your clothes."

Tessa moved to stand in front of phone and slowly began to pull the top up over her head. He gave her directions as she went and Tessa complied. When he had her remove her shorts he had her bend over in front of the camera to show him her ass. The red marks from the paddle were gone and he told her what a shame it was not to see them. Lastly she peeled off her new panties and tossed them into the corner of her room.

"Come closer and play with your tits." His husky voice directed. Tessa complied, giving him a good view and she rubbed and pulled on her tender flesh. She flicked at her nipples and pulled them hard for him, his blue eyes watching every single move that she made.

"Now open the box."

Tessa took up the box and began to pry it open. Curiosity had consumed her for two weeks and she had spent every day wondering what was inside. And in her wildest imaginings, she had not come close to the truth. Inside, underneath a thick layer of tissue paper, was a large rubber dildo. It was the kind with a suction cup at the base but otherwise looked shockingly lifelike, complete with veins and a well defined tip. It was quite large, but not as large as him.

"Stick it on the mirror at the right height to reach your pussy when you're on your hands and knees."

Tessa shivered as she realized where this was going. Still she did as told. Once it was up, it stuck out of the mirror like the wall had some sort of obscene hard on.

"Get on your hands and knees and fuck yourself with it." His thick voice rumbled out from the phone. Tessa hung her head but dared not argue with him. Instead she slowly knelt down in front of the dildo and spread her legs. "Get yourself wet first."

Tessa reached between her legs and began to stroke her clit. She closed her eyes when she did it and tried to image he was behind her, getting ready to fuck her from behind. Maybe watching her do this would get him all worked up for the next time that he saw her and he would fuck her raw. The thought made heat begin to bloom within her. Soon her pussy was wet and she moved her hand back down to the ground. She poised herself in front of the dildo, on all fours like a dog.

Ever so slowly she began to ease herself back onto it. It was firm yet supple enough to almost feel like a real dick inside of her. She moaned as it entered her, trying to imagine how it looked on his screen. He had made her angle the camera so it was off to her side, giving him the perfect view of the dildo as it slid in and out of her.

Tessa began to rock back and forth, the large dildo spreading her pussy as she moved. Once she got a feel for it she began to speed up.

"Open your eyes and look at me."

Tessa's eyes fluttered open as she turned her head to the side and found his face on the screen. His eyes were glued to her, wide and dilated as he watched her fuck herself.

"Harder. Faster."

Tessa picked up the pace, slamming her hips back into the dildo. Low, keening moans began to escape her with every thrust of her hips. Still she watched him. His eyes were transfixed as he called orders to her. Tessa followed him without question. She wondered if he was recoding this video call. If so, she was sure he would be sending her lots of screen shots over the coming weeks.

Soon she could tell that she was close to coming. She hadn't thought she would have an orgasm from riding a rubber dick. Maybe it was because he was watching her and still controlling her every move even over the distance between them. And when she came she threw her head back with a wild cry of pleasure. She stayed locked in place with the dildo firmly in her pussy before she leaned forward and eased off of it. She lowered her head to the ground as her entire body shivered and shook.

"Do you wish that was my dick?" His voice from the phone asked after one endless moment.

"Yes." She admitted as she rolled her head to look at him.

"You gave me a hard on." He informed her as he tilted his phone down so she could see his dick. He had freed it from his pants and it stood large and erect. "I need to rub one out. Take the dildo off the mirror and stick it to the floor."

Tessa pushed her shivering body up and used her nails to pry the dildo off the mirror. She could already tell where this was going as she used the section cup to attach it to the wood floor in front of the camera.

"Now ride it."

Tessa wanted to protest that it was too soon. Her pussy ached and was too sensitive for a another go. But she didn't defy him. Instead she positioned herself above it before she lowered her body weight down onto it.

"Oh god..." She moaned as the hard rubber cock filled her up. Tessa began to move up and down on it, letting it slip out of her pussy before she shimmied onto it once again. When he commanded she began to play with her tits, pulling and pinching as she continued to fuck the dildo. On the screen before her she found him jerking himself off, his hand tight and frantic around his own dick. Tessa sped up and made her tits bounce for him as she rode the dildo. His hands were speeding up, his own face growing red and strained. And when he came she watched in fascination as cum spurted from his dick at high speed and splashed across his hands and pants.

"Oh my god..." She cried again at the sight of it as she followed him into orgasm. It shook her to the very core and she writhed and screamed for him. When it was all over she dropped back down onto all fours so that she could support herself. Her breath was rattling in and out of her like a freight train and she hung her head and tried to get herself under control.

"I can't wait two more weeks for your pussy." His voice rumbled from her phone.

"Come over." She implored. She did not know what possessed her. She didn't even want Quinn in her house. This was her private sanctuary and she did not want it violated by him but all she knew was that a red haze of lust had blanketed her brain like a fog. She was certain that if he didn't fuck her soon, she was going to come apart.

"I'm not your boyfriend." He scoffed at her suggestion. "There is a place called the Playland Bar at 38th and Main. Be there in twenty minutes and wear something slutty."

With that he hung up the phone. Tessa was left kneeling with the dildo still buried in her pussy, staring at the blank screen in confusion. Why did he want to meet her at a bar? If he didn't want to come to her place, they could have at least met up at a hotel. Tessa didn't have time to ponder it. That intersection was at least ten minutes away and she still needed time to get ready. So she forced herself off the dildo and hurried into her closet. She knew that he wouldn't want her to wear a bra or panties so she forwent them as she pulled on a tight black skirt that hit her at mid thigh and coupled it with a red, v neck halter top and black stiletto heels. Tessa called a cab as she scrambled for the elevator. Thankfully there was always a car close by downtown and it was pulling up as she let herself out the front door of her building. She had her own car but this way she would not have to waste time trying to find parking. Soon she was in the back seat of the cab, watching as the downtown streets slipped by her. Traffic was heavy for a Saturday but they pulled up in front of the bar with two minutes to spare. Tessa breathed a sigh of relief. She knew how he felt about punctuality. But the look of the bar gave her pause. It was rough and dingy and not located in the best part of town. She really didn't want to walk in there alone dressed this way but she knew that he was not going to put her in a situation where someone was going to rape her. After all, he didn't like to share his toys. So Tessa took a deep breath as she forced herself to enter the bar.

The inside was as dark and seedy as the outside. Several heads turned at her entrance and she found more than one man studying her with interest. She felt awkward and vulnerable standing there, scanning the darkness for Quinn's familiar face. A sharp whistle drew her attention to the back of the bar and she found him sitting in a dark booth. Tessa made her way toward him with relief.

"Damn." He purred as she neared, his tongue running over his lips as he looked at her. "Nice outfit, slut."

"You're the one that told me to wear it." She reminded him as she slid into the booth beside him. It was a corner booth that wrapped around a round table. He sat at the very back of it and she stopped so that there was plenty of space between them.

"But you're the one that owned it already." He pointed out. He had her there. It was not an outfit that she had bought specially for the occasion. "Get your hot ass over here."

As he said it his hand slapped down on her thigh and yanked her closer to him. He wrapped his arm around her shoulders and drew her close and immediately there was a shot glass in his hands.

"Drink."

"I don't like tequila." She said as she tried to pull her head away.

"I really don't give a shit." He informed her as he shoved it against her lips and grabbed her by her hair, forcing her to tilt her head back. Tessa coughed but managed to swallow it. "There, that wasn't so bad. You need to loosen up."

"I think I'm loose enough." She protested with a wry shake of her head. Why else would she let him fuck her?

"You're the opposite of loose." He replied as he leaned into her. His free hand slipped under the table and was immediately inside her skirt. "You're so tight."

"No! There's a ton of people around!" She hissed as she squeezed her thighs together and tried to pull away from him.

"That's the point." He chuckled as he leaned in to nip at her neck even as his hands became rough. They yanked one of her knees over and forced her leg up and over his thigh. He hooked his other leg around it and held her immobile so that was it was concealed by the table but with her legs now splayed wide open, anyone with the proper view would be able to see her pussy.

"Stop!"" She hissed as his fingers pressed up into her pussy.

"Relax. Look around. Everyone is doing the same."

At his words, her eyes skipped out over the bar. A few people were watching them but others were engaged in their own lewd acts throughout the room. Some were kissing but there was at least two other couples playing with each other below their tables. And in the far corner a man was leaning against the jukebox as a pretty blond gave him a hand job out in the open for all to see.

"What is this place?" She breathed as she looked around in shock.

"This is Playland, princess." He chuckled as he played with her pussy. "People come here to fuck. Not out here in the bar though. That's against the rules. But fingering someone is encouraged."

"Then where?" She asked. She felt her cheeks growing red but she could not tell if it was from embarrassment or the drink.

"You'll find out soon enough." He laughed as he began to suck on her neck. He was probably going to leave her with a hickey but she didn't care. She was too distracted by his hand as he played with her pussy. "Watching you fuck yourself was so hot. Did you like your present?"

"That was your idea of a present?" She asked. Her pussy was starting to grow warm under his touch and she began to relax into the seat behind her.

"I thought it was going to be a present for me too but all if did was get me worked up." He growled into her ear as he shoved two fingers into her pussy all the way up to his knuckles. Tessa gasped and arched her back so she could press herself more firmly into him. "There's my whore. People are watching you right now."

Tessa's eyes skipped around the bar and found that they were indeed being watched. But unlike the last time, there were no cell phones in sight. The bar probably had rules about recording. With a chuckle Quinn withdrew his fingers from her pussy and scooped up another full shot glass.

"Drink."

This time it was a double and she almost gagged as she swallowed it. He smirked as he watched her sputter but she managed to keep it down.

"Are you trying to get me drunk?" She asked.

"I think you will enjoy this a lot more if you're relaxed."

"Enjoy what?" She instantly demanded.

"You'll find out soon enough." He shrugged as he cupped her face and drew her in for a kiss. He immediately forced his tongue down her throat as his free hand slipped into her top and began to kneed her breasts. It was a possessive kiss. He was letting the other men in the room know that even though he was letting them watch, she belonged to him. His tongue probed her long and deep as he kneaded her breasts and pulled on her nipples until they were hard and poking through her shirt. All the while he kept her leg trapped so she was spread wide underneath the table. Even though he had not directed her to, her hand drifted down to his lap and began to rub him through his pants and found him to already be a hard as a rock. He groaned into her mouth as she loosed the zipper and began to stroke him. He continued to invade her mouth with his tongue for several long minutes before her stroking seemed to break something inside of him.

"Let's go." He growled huskily as he pulled his mouth away from hers and gave her a shove out of the booth. Tessa scooted over the old leather and slowly stood. Once she was up he joined her only to force another shot of tequila to her lips. "One more."

Tessa didn't even protest. She merely swallowed it down and then followed him as he grabbed her arm. She had assumed that he was going to lead her out of this place to one of the nearby motels that she had spied on her drive in. But he was guiding her toward a non-descript looking door beside the bar. He tipped his head at the bartender and the man nodded in acknowledgement as Quinn slipped through and dragged her behind him.

Tessa was starting to feel the affects of the alcohol now but it was not enough to distract her from what she saw in the hall that she suddenly found herself in. At least a dozen doors stretched down the length of it, and next to it each was a brightly lit window. The hall itself was pitch black so that meant they could see into the rooms but those on the inside could not see anyone who was out in the hall -- of which there were many. Each room that was in use had at least two or three onlookers watching from the hall.

Quinn guided her over to the first one and directly her to look inside. Tessa gasped as she found a pretty redhead riding and older gentleman, her large tits bouncing with every stroke.

"Quinn...?" Tessa gasped in shock but he cut her off.

"Shut up and watch." Quinn purred in her ear.

There was a small speaker next to the window and the woman's cries of pleasure could be heard through it. Quinn forced her to watch for several minutes before he gave her a tug toward the next window. Inside was a man drilling into a woman's pussy from behind. The next held a three some, a woman kneeling on all fours as one man fucked her in the pussy as she sucked the other's dick.

"That's hot." Quinn rumbled in her ear. "I would love to see you taking two dudes at once but you know I don't share so it's never going to happen. But I bet you'd be good at it."

He tugged her toward the next window and there they found two women in the bed. One was fucking the other with a dildo, their tits squished together and the one on the bottom writhed in pleasure.

"That's even hotter." Quinn's voice was throaty. "I would let a woman fuck you. You ever been with a woman?"

Tessa shook her head no. She found that she was utterly incapable of forming words. Her head was spinning from the alcohol and her mind was numb from the shock of what she was seeing.

"Maybe some other time." He shrugged. "I only paid for the two of us today."

With that he gave her a tug backward. Tessa found that he was guiding her to the empty room behind them.

"No Quinn..." She moaned when she realized what that meant.

"Don't fight me." He warned her as he reached into his pocket and pulled out a key card. "I'd hate to punish you in front of all of these people."

With that the keypad beside the door gave a happy beep as he swiped the card over it before he pushed her into the room.

"Take off your clothes."

"Quinn please..."

"Last warning." He said with a dangerous raise of his brow as he began to remove his belt. She knew that he would have no problems whipping her with it in front of all of those people and she doubted any of them would blink at the punishment. They were probably used to watching S&M. The window beside the door was dark so there was no way to tell if anyone was watching but on some instinctual level, she knew that they were. A few had started to move in their direction when they realized that a new couple was moving into a room.

Tessa felt her cheeks flare bright with shame as she started to do as instructed. Slowly she pulled her halter top off before shimmying out of her short skirt.

"Lay down on the bed, face down." He was instructing. Tessa slowly did as told, her eyes following him as he made his way over to a wall of toys. "Don't worry. They clean the room and the toys after each use."

He must have seen the look of horror on her face and it made him smile. Quinn selected a few items before he began to move back toward the bed.

"Relax and enjoy it slut." He chuckled as he grabbed her by her ankles and dragged her toward him. "You liked those three dudes watching you last time. And no one here knows you."

"I don't want to do this." She moaned as she tried to turn her face away from the window.

"I don't really give a shit what you want." He informed her before he grabbed her hair and forced her to look back at the window. "Let them see your pretty face."

And with that he got to work. His first order or business was fastening restraints to her. He informed her that it was called a frog-restraint as he began to buckle her in. He fitted the first strap tightly around her right thigh. It had two shackles on it and he attached the first one to her right wrist before forcing her to bend her right ankle behind her for the second cuff. Once her right side was secure he repeated it for the left. When he was done, the awkward pull of the restraints forced her to perch face down on the bed with her ass sticking straight up in the air and all of her weight balanced on her torso.

"Let's give them a taste of what brought us here." He chuckled as she felt him squirt lube on her pussy. The stress of what was happening had dried her up but he was not going to let that deter him. The next thing she knew, something hard was being pressed into her pussy. Tessa craned her neck and found him pushing a large dildo into her. She squirmed and tried to wiggle away from it but the restraints kept her wide open for him. By now her pussy was accustomed to taking his giant cock so it readily accepted the dildo. With a flick of his fingers he turned it on, jumping straight to it's highest setting without bothering to warm her up first. Tessa moaned and arched her back as he began to move it in and out of her.

"That's it princess, give them a show." Quinn encouraged. Once again her head was spinning and her body started to melt as the alcohol took over.

Quinn continued to move the dildo in and out of her and Tessa was swept away by her emotions. Shame and humiliation roiled within her, but also a confusing burst of pleasure and exhilaration. She could not help but think of the people in the hall that were watching them ... watching <em>her</em>. They were turned on by her. She bet they were all imagining that it was them in here with her tied down and her vulnerable pussy open for the taking. They were probably all imagining what they would do to her if they could. But it was Quinn that controlled her. Quinn who decided what happened to her body. And she realized that he was getting to live his fantasy right now. Complete domination of her in front of others. He was still punishing her for high school by owning her now. And Tessa was loving every degrading second of it.

"Tell me when you're coming." Quinn demanded over the sound of the whirring dildo.

Suddenly she realized that her pussy was wet from her own juices now and they mixed and mingled with the lube and sent it dripping down her thigh. She was trying to buck her hips but the restraints were keeping her immobile. Her moans were growing, coming high and needy now.

"I'm coming..." Her voice began to shake as she felt the pleasure build. But the second that she spoke he pulled the dildo out of her pussy.

"No you're not." He informed her with a laugh as she howled in frustration and anger. He tossed the dildo to the side and the next thing that she knew, he was in front of her. His shirt was hanging open to expose his well muscled chest, and he pulled his pants down around his ass as he settled in in front of her. One hand balled in her hair and forced her head up at an unnatural angle.

"Suck my dick." He snarled as he swayed his hips side to side and slapped her sharply across her cheeks with his cock. Tessa opened her mouth as commanded and immediately he shoved himself inside. Tessa choked and gagged, doing her best to suck on him as he began to thrust into her throat. He had her head between his hands, holding her steady as he slid between her lips.

"You like to get fucked in the face, don't you?" He asked as he ground into her. She tried to responded but her words were cut off by his dick. He pulled out of her mouth briefly to allow her to answer.

"Yes!" She gasped for air as she said it.

"Tell the people out there what you like." He demanded.

"I like your cock in my mouth! I like the taste of your cum!"

"Then drink it all." He growled as he shoved his dick back into her mouth. Tessa gagged as he immediately bottomed out. Her chin rested against his balls as he began to slide in and out of her throat.

"She's deep throating me." He moaned to those people watching in the hall. "Holy shit, this bitch can suck a dick!"

As he said it he pulled back and Tessa took a desperate gasp for hair before he slammed into her once again. His thrusts were becoming more frantic, spurred on by the fact that he had an audience. In and out, Tessa gasping and gagging but still sucking his cock with abandon. Finally he slammed into her with a howl and she felt his cock jerk wildly in her throat. Desperately she swallowed, his cum hot and salty in her mouth. Finally he pulled his cock out of her with a contented moan. Tessa dropped her head down to the bed, her body heaving as she gasped for breath.

"You did good." He informed her as he made his way back around the bed and disappeared behind her once again. "I think you earned a reward."

Another squirt of lube hit her and this time she was horrified to feel him start to play with her ass. Tessa moaned as he worked a finger into her. This time it didn't hurt as much. She must have been getting used to it. He inserted a second finger and worked her asshole for a few minutes before he pulled his hand away. Tessa was confused by this. Normally he used three fingers when prepping her simply due to the sheer size of his cock. She tried to craned her neck to look behind her and she could tell they he was messing with something in front of him, his hands hovering around his cock as if attaching something to it. And when he finally turned so she could see, Tessa let out a deep moan at what she saw. He had attached something to his penis, another dildo somehow nestled above his own cock which was already hard again. Tessa realized that he had found a way to double penetrate her without having to share her with another man.

"Ready to have two holes filled at the same time?" He asked her as he lined his cock up with her pussy while bringing the dildo to her ass. Tessa clenched her hands into fists as he began to bear down. Ever so slowly he eased into her, her ass and pussy filling at the same time. The dildo was large but not huge and fit snugly inside her ass while his massive cock stretched her pussy. Tessa had never felt so full. Quinn pulled back before rocking forward again and Tessa gasped as she felt both move within her at the same time. He started out slow, his strokes meticulous and smooth but soon he began to gain momentum. He was usually so careful when he fucked her in the ass due to his size but the dildo was smaller than his dick so he was be was being a little rougher then normal. In and out he slid until he was all but slamming into her. He would groan with each thrust as she let out sharp gasps as the air was forced completely from her body.

"That's a good slut." He moaned as he began to slap her ass in time with each of his thrusts. "I can tell you want to cum. Scream for your fans."

Tessa was panting like a dog now as she moaned and squirmed before him. Tingles were racing through her and she knew that when she came, it was going to shatter her. He small cries of pleasure grew louder until the dam finally broke and an orgasm hit her like a tsunami. Tessa threw her head back was a scream so loud that she was sure they would have heard it outside even without the speakers. Her entire body spasmed as every muscle locked as one. Her pussy clamped down on his dick with such force that he could not stop himself from coming. Quinn slammed into her, burying his cock to the hilt as he sprayed another load of cum inside of her. After a moment he sagged, bracing himself with his hands on either side of her hips. Both he and the dildo stayed rammed inside of her, kept there by the weight of his large body.

"Oh my god..." Tessa whimpered beneath him.

"That's right. I am your god." He chuckled at her words as he finally pushed himself up. He pulled out of her, Tessa crying out as his cock and the dildo left her body.

"No more..." She moaned as she laid limply below him. Her arms and legs were numb but the restraints kept her locked firmly in place. "I'm done..."

"We're done when I say we're done." He informed her with a laugh. "And honey, I'm just getting started. But I do need a little rest."

As he said it he moved away from the bed. Her eyes followed him to the wall of toys. He had already taken the dildo attachment off of his dick and tucked himself back into his pants. He seemed to select two new items before he turned back to her.

"I thought you said that we're taking a break." Tessa protested.

"I'm taking a break." He corrected. "But there's not rest for the wicked, princess."

As he said it he pressed something cold and hard into her backside. Tessa tensed as her already abused asshole was forced open once again. Whatever it was short but thick and came to stop a few inches inside of her. But she could feel a rounded metal disc against her ass and realized with horror that he had just inserted a butt plug into her. Quinn gave the hard metal plug a forceful tap and Tessa yelped in shock and pain as it vibrated against her pelvic bone.

"Perfect." He grinned as he began to undo the straps of the frog restraint. One by one her arms and legs were freed and she let them fall down to the bed in exhaustion. Yet Quinn did not let her rest. His hands immediately slipped under her shoulders and hauled her up. He forced her to walk across the room until she was standing only a few feet in front of the window. This close she could see vague silhouettes on the other side and could tell that there were quite a few people watching them. Quinn pulled her to a stop and reached above him, chains rattling as he pulled a pair of shackles down from the ceiling. Tessa shuddered as he snapped them closed on her wrists. Next he reached down to snap other shackles on her ankles, these ones separated by a spreader bar designed to keep her legs wide open. Once each of her appendages was securely shackled, he pressed a button on the wall and the chains began to retract. Tessa's arms were guided upward and Quinn did not turn off the motor until her entire body was stretched taught. There she hung, her feet pressed flat on the ground and spread wide while her arms were chained above her. With her properly suspended, he produced the second item that he had taken from the wall. It was a small, u-shaped piece of silicone. He shoved it into her spread pussy and when he moved his hand away it stayed firmly in place thanks to the u-shape wrapping snugly around her pussy. The way it sat, it extended a few inches inside of her while the other end pressed firmly into her clit.

"Remote control." Quinn smirked as he showed her a little black box before slipping it into his pocket and heading for the door.

"Wait!" She gasped. "Where are you going?"

"To have some lunch." He replied as if it was the most obvious question in the world. "Just relax and give your fans a show. I'll be back in about an hour."

"No!" Tessa cried, but he was already pulling the door open. She caught a glimpse of several forms on the other side before he disappeared and the door swung shut behind him. Tessa looked around in panic as she tugged at the chains but he had secured her too tightly. She only had a moment to sit with the fear before the little device between her legs came to life. Tessa gasped in shock as the part inside of her began to vibrate even as the part on the outside felt like it was sucking on her clit.

"Oh god..." Tessa moaned as her head rolled backward. She had never felt anything like that before. Her chest heaved as her breathing began to speed up and she knew that the people on the other side of the glass were getting a spectacular view of her tits. The device continued to pulse and suck, her already tender clit responding in an instant. Soon her hips were undulating in time with it as if she was riding an invisible cock. Tessa clenched her hands around the chains and screamed as she came, her toes curling as she saw stars. The device continued to pulse for another moment before it suddenly shut down. He must have turned it off remotely.

Tessa's head rolled forward and hung limply. She just wanted to fall into the bed behind her and sleep but there was no rest to be hand in this position. If she passed out, all of the pressure would go to her wrists as she hung from the chains. But her widely spread feet made standing also difficult. Tessa shifted around as best she could, switching her weight from foot to foot as she tried to give herself a break. She had no idea how much time had passed but she was just starting to grow accustomed to her predicament when the device attached to her pussy sprang to life once again. Tessa cried out in shock before she began to rock her hips once again. The motion made her boobs jiggle and quiver as she fought the orgasm. But the sensations were too powerful and in the end she lost the fight with a wild cry. It took a long while for the device to shut off this time. He must have been out in the bar eating his lunch and unable to see when she came. A reprieve finally came and she slumped forward against the chains. The process repeated herself at unpredictable intervals. Device on, orgasm, device off, rest. Three more times he drove her to cum. She was left exhausted and her pussy throbbing by the time she heard to door open again.

"Miss me?" He asked with a grin.

"You asshole." She groaned in exhaustion at the sight of him.

"That wasn't very nice." The tisked at her as he disappeared behind her. She felt something metal hit the plug in her butt and it sent pain flaring through her body. "I just gave you a shit ton of orgasms. You should be more grateful."

"I hate you." She moaned as she tugged at the chains.

"You hate me, but you love being used by me." He pointed out as his big body pressed into her from behind. He pulled the device from her pussy before he reached up and circled her wrists with his large hands and pulled them down off the chains. Yet he left the cuffs firmly in place around her wrists even though they were no longer attached to anything. She could only imagine that he planned to use them later. Her arms dropped to her side in exhaustion as his own came up and circled her body. Due to the spreader bar still attached to her ankles, he had to duck walked her toward the window and Tessa found herself shoved up against it with an oomph. Her tits were squished against the glass and her cheek pressed tightly to it. She pressed her hands flat against the glass and tried to push herself away but he had be pinned. Her feet were still attached to the spreader bar so she was wide open and unable to defend herself as he entered her from behind.

"Admit it to these nice people." He prompted as he started to thrust into her. Tessa wanted to fight him but she was too exhausted, and even if she wasn't, she could never win against him. "Admit that you like it."

"I like it when you use me." She moaned against the glass. "But I hate you, you piece of shit."

"Such name calling for a filthy whore that walked in this bar willingly. You came when I called you, just like a dog."

"Fuck you." She growled, only to gasp when he thrust violently upward.

"No sweetheart, I'm the one fucking you. Because I own you. Tell everyone how you let someone you hate fuck you raw. Tell them."

"You own me." Tessa moaned as his big dick continued to ram into her from behind.

"And you like it." He laughed.

"Yes..." Tessa moaned, barely able to form a coherent thought in her addled brain. Between the alcohol, exhaustion and abuse, she had no concept for the world around her. All that existed was him and his dick.

"What do you like?" He prompted.

"For you to use me." She sobbed. "For you to own me.

"That's a good fuck toy." He groaned at her words. They were spurring his own excitement. He had hated her for so long, his anger and resentment over whatever slights she had dealt him over the years bubbling over in this moment. When he had been younger he had felt helpless to retaliate, but now he could dominate her and bend her to his will. Tessa both loved it and hated it.

Tessa felt rubbed raw and knew that there would be no orgasm for her this time. But Quinn continued to pound her pussy like a jackhammer. And when he came he pulled her hair and screamed that she was a whore as his cum painted her insides. Tessa was sobbing as he pulled out of her, every cell within her shaking. The moment he finished with her he began to haul her backward. He threw her to the bed and prompted attached her shackled wrists to the headboard. He then moved to her feet and removed the spreader bar before attaching her ankle shackles to the footboard at the bottom of the bed.

"You said some very nasty things about me while I was fucking you." He informed her as he moved up to her face and secured a blindfold over it. "You need to be punished for that."

"No Quinn ... please..."

"Shut the fuck up and take your punishment whore, or I'll open that door and let every man in the hall come in and run a train on you." He snarled. Tessa wasn't sure if he meant it or not. He kept saying that he didn't want to share her, but would he use it as punishment? She doubted it. It was probably more empty threats meant to cow her into obedience. Still her mouth snapped shut with an audible click just in case.

"That's better." He chuckled as he pushed himself up from the bed. She could hear him move toward the dresser and she wondered what new torture device he was now retrieving. He had strapped her down so that she was facing up so he couldn't have been planning to spank her this time. But barely a moment passed before she had her answer. She heard a vaguely familiar found fill the air before something small yet incredible painful slapped down against her nipple. Tessa couldn't see it, but she knew that he was now hitting her with a riding crop. It shifted and slapped against her other nipple before he aimed a sharp blow to her pussy.

"Do you have anything to say to me?" He asked as he continued to slap the riding crop down, alternating between blows to her nipples and pussy. But when he flicked it against her clit was when he finally got a good response. She howled in pain even as her nipples involuntarily hardened in pleasure.

"I'm sorry..." She sobbed as she fought the tears. "I'm sorry I called you a piece of shit. I'm sorry that I disrespected you. Please stop..."

"Just a few more to help the lesson sink in." He warned her before he flicked out with his wrist and slapped the crop against her tender pussy once again. Each of her sensitive spots was hit a few more times before he thew the crop away and climbed into bed on top of her.

"Why do you make me punish you?" He asked before he slammed his hard cock into her once again. "Just keep your smart mouth shut and let your pussy take a pounding."

Tessa endeavored to do as told. The entire bed shook from the force of his thrusts as he grunted and growled like a wild animal above her. He was riding her hard, her pussy helpless against the abuse. She knew that the people in the hall had a good view of his cock as it pounded relentlessly into her. All Tessa could do was take it. He had spread her eagle and the massive weight of his body was driving her down into the bed. She couldn't even bring her hips up to meet him. Still she writhed beneath him as he ravaged her body. And when he came it was with a scream as he impaled her with his cock. Tessa's entire body went rigid from the force of it. When he was done he collapsed on top of her, not even caring that she could barely breathe from the weight of him.

"Did you learn your lesson, whore?" He asked as he finally pulled out of her. "Don't ever talk back to me in front of others again."

Tessa could only whimper and nod her head. He seemed satisfied with that as he clambered off of her. She watched him as he pulled up his pants and buttoned his shirt before moving over to a mirror on the far wall to make sure he liked how he looked. Finally he moved back toward her and began to unhook her from the shackles.

"Get dressed, were done." He rumbled as he watched her scoot off the bed.

"But ... the plug ..." She murmured as she gestured helplessly at her backside.

"Oh, I paid for that." He informed her with a chuckle. "You're going to wear it home."

Tessa nodded in resignation as she made her way over to where she had dropped her clothes. The feel of it inside of her was awkward and she struggled to slip on her skirt and top before sliding her feet into her heels. Once she was dressed he gestured for her to join him at the door. Tessa's face flamed red at the thought of going out there and coming face to face with the people that had just watched her get fucked by him. But Quinn seemed unbothered as he pulled the door open and shoved her outside. Despite being packed with people, the hallway was dead silent except for the moans and cries from the speakers of people being fucked in other rooms. But those that had been standing at her window were now painfully silent. There were at least seven men and women that had been clustered around their window and all eyes were now focused hungrily on her. Quinn nudged her forward through the crowd and Tessa felt hands moving over her as she walked. Quinn smirked and seemed amused by people fondling her breasts and smacking her ass as they made their way passed them. As long as no one was trying to fuck her, he was happy letting them touch.

Tessa breathed a sigh of relief once they reached the end of the hall and Quinn guided her back out into bar. She stared longingly at the front door but Quinn guided her toward the counter instead.

"Just give him a moment to get your copy." The man behind the bar called to Quinn. Quinn nodded with a grunt as he directed her over to the bar and forced her to sit on a stool. Even with the padding on the stool, it pressed up into the plug in her ass with discomfort. Quinn gestured at a tequila bottle and the bartender quickly poured him shot that he immediately forced down her throat.

"You earned that." He rumbled beside her.

"What did he mean by 'your copy'?" Tessa asked. She was surprised to find her voice rough and weak but he still heard her.

"You're not allowed to make recordings back there." He said as he tipped his head at the door that led to the playrooms. "But there are cameras everywhere. If you want copies, you gotta pay for them. And baby, I paid for the deluxe package."

"What do they do with the originals?" She asked in worry.

"Don't worry, your pretty little face isn't going to end up on the internet." He laughed at her. "The originals are erased if you don't want to buy them."

Tessa was appeased somewhat, but Quinn would have his own copies. And she knew that she was in store for another few weeks of random pictures and video clips being texted to her.

"The best part about it is that they also record the people in the hall." Quinn informed her. "I'm going to get to hear everything that was said about you while I fucked you. I wonder if any of them jerked off?"

Tessa felt her cheeks burn in shame but thankfully she was saved from having to answer him by a thin, wirey man slipping out of a backroom and making his way toward them. He handed Quinn a thumb drive, his eyes running over Tessa with disinterest before he turned and made his way back to the office. Tessa supposed he had seen it all at this point and watching her get fuck raw was nothing new to him. Quinn paid for her last shot before he pulled her up from the bar.

"Let's go princess."

"I need to call a cab." She informed him as she attempted to pull out her phone.

"You ain't getting in a strange dude's car looking like that." He scoffed as he peered down at her. "You're drunk, you reek of sex, and you look like you've been ridden hard ... which you have. I'm not risking someone thinking they can take advantage of this situation. You're my fuck toy. I'll drive you home."

Tessa did not protest as he guided her out of the bar and directed her down the street. They made their way into the pay lot next to the bar and Tessa saw his SUV parked within. Once there he opened the passenger door for her and shoved her inside. Tessa shivered, remembering the last time she was in this car. But he merely closed the door behind her and rounded to the driver's seat. Tessa buckled herself in as he began to guide the car out of the lot. She relaxed as he drove and rested her spinning head on the cool window beside her. He said not a word as he drove. Tessa actually felt herself beginning to drift off. But a few minutes later the car around her jerked to a halt.

"Fucking traffic." Quinn snarled as he laid on his horn. But she could already tell that it would be no use. Red taillights stretched before them. Quinn glowered out the window for a moment before his eyes slid over to her.

"Come here." He demanded as he gave the seat beside him a pat. Tessa hesitated and that only seemed to annoy him. "Now!"

She jumped slightly and unbuckled herself before carefully sliding herself over the seat.

"We might as well make the best of this situation." He shrugged before he reached into his lap. Quickly he unzipped his pants and pulled out his cock. Tessa was horrified to find it hard and throbbing once again. She shook her head as frustrated tears slipped from her eyes. She had thought they were done. He merely laughed at her reaction as he grabbed her by her hair and forced her face down into his lap. "Suck my dick you slut."

Tessa sniffled, but did just that. Her mouth opened wide to receive him, her tongue darting out to lick the length of him before she took him fully into her. Her mouth began to run the length of his cock and she knew that if the person in the car in front of them looked in their rearview mirror, they would probably be able to see her head bobbing up and down.

"I love it when you suck me off." He moaned as he let his head loll back against his seat rest. Tessa could not respond. Instead she lifted one hand and began to play with his balls as she worked him with her mouth. His own hands moved to her hair and roughly forced her head down, Quinn setting the pace that he liked. Soon his hips were jerking up to meet her mouth as Tessa loosened her throat and allowed him full access. She was deep throating him, and the head of his cock slid in and out of her effortlessly now.

"Holy shit, you suck like a vacuum." He moaned before he threw his head back and came with a roar. Tessa expertly took the cum that he shot down her throat, only pulling off of him once he was spent.

"Clean me up." He snapped as he shoved her head back down. Tessa knew what he wanted and immediately began to lap his spent semen off the warm skin of his dick.

"Traffic's moving again but don't you dare stop until I'm clean." He informed her as she felt the car begin to ease forward. Once she had licked him spotless, she tucked his dick back into his pants before she buckled herself back into her own seat.

"Next time, we're going to Roger's house for dinner." He said thoughtfully as he drove. "I want you wearing your new butt plug all night. After dinner, go to the shed on the back of his property where he keeps his boat. I want you to strip naked and get on the ground with your ass in the air facing the door and wait for me. I want that plug in your pretty little ass to be the first thing I see when I walk in."

"What is someone else comes in and sees me like that?" She asked in worry.

"Then they are in for a treat." He laughed at her distress as they finally pulled up in front of her building. "Get out."

Tessa said not another word as she opened the door and scooted from the car. The moment the door swung shut he took off with a squeal of his tires. Now that they were in a nice neighborhood he didn't seem to have any qualms about leaving her on the side of the road. Tessa sighed as she turned and made her way into her building. No one really paid her any mind. To them she probably looked like a young woman coming home after a long night at the club. At least, that's what she hoped they thought. Tessa tried not to think too much about it as she retreated to her apartment for a shower and a well deserved nap.

Tessa slipped into the shed, her steps light and hesitant. Tonight's dinner had been torture for her. It had been so hard to sit calmly in her chair with the plug pressing into her the entire time. Still she had smiled pleasantly and made small talk with the others. She caught Quinn's knowing smirks every time she would shift her bottom with a wince. He had been watching her closely throughout dinner, his eyes deep and hungry. She knew that she was in for a good, hard fucking from him tonight. Her pussy tingled just from thinking about it.

After dinner she had faked another work phone call before slipping outside. His eyes had followed her as she left and she knew that he wouldn't be far behind her. Her steps had made short work of the garden path that led to the back of the property and the large shed that was hidden behind the trees. It was dark back here but she took comfort in that fact. It hid her from prying eyes. Still, she had made very careful that no one was following her as she made her way outside.

Now as she stood inside the shed, she found it completely dark within. She blinked her eyes rapidly and tried to adjust to the darkness. Cautiously she slipped forward and made her way toward the boat. As her eyes adjusted to the dimness she could see a blanket spread out on the ground before her. Tessa made her way toward it and reached down to flick on the lantern that was sitting in the middle of it. There beside the lantern was a single sheet of paper with only a few words scrawled across it in Quinn's surprisingly nice script.

<em>Ass Up Princess</em>

Tessa scowled but she knew that she needed to do as told. If he didn't find her waiting exactly as directed, it would be her ass that paid the price. Yet he never seemed to lack reasons to punish her. Tessa realized that she had never once been with him when he didn't punish her for something. She had a suspicion that what he was really punishing her for was high school, not anything that she had currently done. Tessa supposed that she would be paying for that as long as they continued meeting like this.

Tessa put it out of her mind as she began to undress. It only took a moment to pull her pretty, sequined gold slip dress over her head and toss it onto a nearby box. Once she was naked she knelt down on the blanket and settled her forehead onto her folded arms with her ass sticking straight up in the air.

Tessa wondered how long he was going to make her wait like this. They never had very long together at these parties. He tried to squeeze as much activity as he could into 20-30 minutes but anything longer than that would be noticed. As much as he loved to threaten to fuck her in front of all of their friends, part of the secret thrill of it was the fear of getting caught. He knew that if that happened, she wouldn't want to continue with these activities. More than likely, she would simply quit the dinner club and drop out of everyone's lives in shame. Quinn would never let that happen so he tried to be discreet while their friends were around. She supposed that was why he had taken her to the bar so he could live out his voyeurism fantasy without anyone they knew finding out.

Just as she had suspected, he had been sending her pictures and videos from their session at the bar. And whatever recording system they had in place there, it was a million times more high tech than his cell phone. Tessa had felt like she had been watching herself in a high budget porno.

A creak from the door behind her pulled her from her tumbling thoughts and she immediately tensed. She didn't move her ass from out of the air but she did peer down between her legs and saw that it was Quinn that has just entered the shed. He took a piece of wood and wedged it over the bolt in the door to lock them in before he turned his attention to her. Tessa rested her head on her folded arms once again and waited.

Quinn was moving slowly, letting the anticipation build in her. And once he was right behind her he knelt down, so close that she could feel the heat of his body against her thighs. Suddenly his calloused hands skimmed her backside, running over her smooth skin before he gave her butt a hard slap. It made the plug shift and vibrate within her and Tessa moaned at the feel of it.

Quinn continued to tease her this way for several endless minutes before she felt him yank the plug out without warning. He laughed at the startled sound that she made but wasted not a moment and pressed the head of his cock into her ass. He wasn't even going to prep her this time, he trusted that the butt plug had done it for him. Still she felt a squirt of lube splash against her ass before he began to push his way inside of her.

"Quinn..." She moaned as she squeezed her hands into tight fists against the pain. Even with the butt plug spreading her for the last several hours, his dick was still frightfully large.

"Shut up." He warned her with a hard slap on her ass, this one stinging where the last one had been playful. Tessa grit her teeth and tried to relax. Finally he was all the way inside of her and he paused there as Tessa heard the unmistakable sound of his cell phone camera click. He had just taken a close up of his dick in her ass.

"I hate you." She moaned the words, even as he laughed at her humiliation.

"I hate you too, but you're the one with a dick up your ass, not me." Came his gleeful voice as he began to move. His hands were at her hips and he pulled her back onto him with every thrust. Despite her anger at the situation, she felt that warm glow deep within her tummy start to roll through her. He kept hitting her g spot and it was sending fire racing through her. His grunts filled the shed as he slid in and out of her ass and Tessa could not stop her hips from snapping back to meet him.

Like that they fucked like animals on the dirty shed floor with Roger's boat standing silent sentinel beside them. She remembered the time Roger had taken them all out of the lake in this boat, and now it was the only witness to her getting plowed in the ass.

Tessa felt that fire grow to an inferno until it rushed from her with a cry of pure ecstasy. Tessa threw her hear back and cried out as she came and heard him moan as the sound drove him mad. His pace picked up until he released himself into her with an animalistic howl.

"Oh, you dirty whore." He panted as he fell down onto the blanket and pulled her with him. He locked her up in his arms and threw one leg over her body to keep her pinned against him. Tessa had always thought it cute when men held her after sex but there was nothing cute about this. It was cold and rough and possessive.

"Did you ever imagine that I would be the one to make you scream like that?" Quinn asked.

"No." Tessa replied in annoyance. Why did he have to taunt her every time he fucked her? Why couldn't he just let them both get off and then leave her alone?

"When you first saw me in high school, back before we both hated each other, tell me what you thought of me."

"That you were hot." She admitted. "I wanted you to ask me out."

"I only asked out girls who I thought I could fuck." He informed her. "Back then, you were such an ice princess. I didn't think you would even let me get to second base."

"Is that why you call me princess?" She asked in surprise. The way he always said it made it clear that he was not using it as a term of endearment. His voice always dripped with contempt when he said it.

"Yup." He nodded as he reached down and gave one tit a hard squeeze. "Stuck up, entitled, frigid bitch of a princess that thinks she is better than everyone else."

"I do not..." She began to protest but his hand shot out to cover her mouth and stifle her words.

"Liar." He snapped down at her. "Ever since we were fifteen you did everything that you could to embarrass me. Always competing..."

"Always winning!" She returned as she snapped her head to the side and managed to knock his hand away. "And I never meant to embarrass you but you couldn't be gracious about losing so you acted like a bully. You tormented me for years! So I tormented you right back. I liked it when I beat you because you deserved it!"

"And now you're gonna get what <em>you</em> deserve." He rumbled as he jerked upward and pulled her with him from the ground.

"Let go of me Quinn!" She let her anger get the best of her as she tried to squirm out of his grip. He ignored her as he dragged her to a wooden workbench in the back of the shed. Too late did she notice cuffs already attached to each of its legs. He had obviously come early to set up the blanket and lantern and leave her a note, she was a fool to think that he hadn't devised other surprises for her as well.

Once at the workbench he bent her over it and forced her hands above her head to the cuffs attached to the other side. Quickly he secured her wrists before moving down to her feet and attaching the cuffs she had seen near the ground. They had been spaced far apart and forced her legs open wide for him. And with her hands cuffed above her, she laid face down, her tits and stomach flat against the smooth table.

Tessa heard him rummaging around and craned her neck to find that he was now holding a backpack in his hands. From it he pulled a ball gag and Tessa tried to toss her head but he forced it into her mouth and locked it tight. Once she was bound and gagged he moved back to the bag and pulled out a clean towel and a bottle of water before he began to clean his dick.

"After I punish you for opening your smart slut mouth, I'm going to fuck you so hard I tear you in two." He informed her darkly as he continued to scrub. "I was just in your ass. I should fuck you dirty and let you get an infection but I want to keep your pussy clean for me."

With the he tossed the water and the towel away before he rummaged in the bag once again. When he pulled it out, he was holding a flogger. The end of it was made of glass and shaped like a dildo, while its leather straps were long and fanned out along his skin.

"Eight inches. Braided." He informed her as he gave it a little flick and let it sting across her ass. Tessa strained and moaned from the delicious pain. That had just been a gentle caress compared to what she knew was coming. Another switch across her ass, this time harder. "I've known you for ten years, all of them miserable. At first, I thought you needed one lash for every year that I've known you, but I've decided to double it because of your mouth. You need to learn to shut up and show me some respect. Maybe this will teach you."

With that he lashed out, the thick trails of the braided flogger falling across her ass and sending a dizzying mixture of pleasure and pain through her ... but the pain was slightly wining this time.

"One." He counted before he brought the flogger down once again with a sharp thwack. Tessa threw her head back and howled in protest from the treatment. "Two..."

On and on he went, Quinn counting each lash with delight. By the time he was halfway through, she was yelling muffled words into her gag.

"What was that?" He asked in amusement as he paused the flogging to remove her gag. "I didn't hear you."

"Please stop..." She moaned as she tried to shift her on her feet and maneuver her stinging ass away from him. "I'll do anything you want..."

"You already do anything I want." He chuckled as he ran his hand up and down her back. It was almost a soothing gesture, but Tessa knew that he was just mocking her. "Take your punishment whore."

With that the gag was back on and be brought the flogger back down on her with a firm flick of his wrist. He resumed his counting and by the time he reached fifteen her mind was enveloped in a red haze. By eighteen she couldn't even cry out anymore. And by twenty she had given up, her body slack and her mind a jumble.

To add one last insult to his domination of her, he took the smooth glass end of the dildo and inserted it into her ass. Tessa moaned as her muscles tightened around it and pulled it down until it reached the flared base where it met the leather braids. There it lodged like a tail.

Quinn laughed as he reached down and pulled the gag from her mouth before he stepped back. Once again she found his cell phone in his hands, his flash on in the dim light of the room as he once again captured her humiliation for posterity in video form.

"I'm done with your back talk, do you understand?" He asked her.

"Yes." She whispered.

"Who owns you?" He asked as he gave the braids of the flogger a tugged and jiggled the glass end inside of her.

"You do." She moaned at the treatment.

"You've said that before but I don't think you understand your place yet. You're my slave. Say it."

"I'm your slave." She moaned back with tears in her eyes.

"My fuck slave." He elaborated for her. "No more back talk, no more smart mouth. Understand?"

"Yes."

"Yes what?" He demanded as he gave the flogger in her ass another tug.

"I don't understand." She admitted in confusion.

"What does a slave call the person that owns her?" He asked with a malicious smile. Tessa stilled at the question as she felt a new sensation fill her -- revulsion. She immediately knew what he wanted her to say.

"Master?" She spat the horrible word out. It tasted bad on her lips.

"Master." He nodded. "If you ever call me by name again without my permission first, you won't like what happens. Am I making myself clear?"

"Yes." She nodded. He growled at her response and aimed a sharp slap on her abused ass. Tessa cried out in pain before she continued in a rush. "Yes Master!"

"Good whore." He nodded in approval before he moved behind her and slammed his cock into her pussy without warning. Tessa cried out as her body was rocked violently forward, the chains on her ankles pulling tight and pinching her skin. The flogger was still inside her ass and it moved and shifted every time that he pounded into her. Every time he would pull back until he almost pulled all the way our of her, before he would ram back in with all the force in his powerful hips. He had said that he was going to break her in two and he had meant it.

In and out of her he drove his dick, the workbench creaking with every move that he made. He was slamming into her so hard that the work bench was hitting the far wall every time he rammed her.

Tessa felt a hand in her hair yank her head backward but she was pulled so tight by the chains that there wasn't really wasn't much give. Still he held her with her head pulled back and yanked her hair with every thrust. Tessa tried to stay as still as possible and focus on her breathing. Deep wheezes were escaping her in time with his rhythm. She didn't think it was possible but soon he began to speed up even more, his hips working like pistons as he ground into her. And when he came, his dick dove deeper than ever before and shot a hot load of cum into her pussy. She could feel him shaking against her, every muscle in his body pulled taught like a violin string. When he finally pulled out of her it was with a groan of pleasure. She felt his cum automatically begin to dribble down her thighs as he began to unlock her chains. The moment she was free he grabbed her by her hair and forced her down onto her knees before him.

"Clean it." He demanded. Tessa said nothing as she began to lick his cock clean. His eyes watched her closely as she worked, his own tongue licking his lips as he started at her, transfixed. "You love my cock, don't you?"

"Yes." She murmured, pausing her job just long enough to reply before she took him in her mouth once again. He scowled at her answer and pulled her face away, aiming a slap to her cheek as she looked up at him in surprise.

"Yes what?" He demanded.

"Yes Master." She whispered, dropping her eyes in embarrassment.

"You hate that, don't you?" He laughed as he looked down at her in glee. "It's demoralize, isn't it? It's humiliating and dehumanizing. Say it again."

"Master." She whimpered as she nuzzled her face against his cock and tried to hide.

"Look at me and say it." He demanded. Tessa took a deep breath as she forced herself to lift her eyes. She found him staring down at her with a smirk. Tessa marshalled her resolve and hoped her voice didn't shake.

"Master." She forced herself to say, her eyes never leaving her.

"And don't you ever forget it again." He warned her before he shoved her mouth back down on his dick. She could feel his eyes on her, watching in fascination as her mouth worked over him. And when he spoke next there was a note of amusement in his voice. "Look at you. The mighty Tessa Daniels kneeling at my feet ... licking my cock and calling me master. I wish I could go back in time and show my 16 year old self a picture of you right now. Maybe I wouldn't have been so pissed off all the time if I knew I was going to get to do this to you someday. Or that you would do it willingly."

Tessa shuddered at his words, but none of them were lies or exaggerations. He dominated her and often used force to do it. There were no safe words here and he didn't stop even when she asked. But she kept coming back for more. And despite the pain and humiliation, she loved every minute of it. Or maybe it was <em>because</em> of those things. Just thinking about it made her mind churn inside her so she pushed it all away and concentrated on this. <em>This</em> she could do.

Tessa continued to clean him, not stopping until all of their combined juices had been polished from his cock.

"Now lay back down, just like you were when I walked in."

Tessa slowly turned her back to him and lowered her head back down onto her arms with her ass sticking straight up in the air. He chuckled as he reached down and jiggled the flogger that was still imbedded in her ass. He began to move it in and out of her before he got tired of it and yanked it out.

"Did you know that I got a call from the Playland the other day?" He said thoughtfully as he looked down at her tender, red flesh. His hands were ghosting over her ass cheeks and thighs and they sent shivers in their wake. "They are getting requests for you. You're a star, princess. Should we go back someday?"

"Do I have a choice?" She asked.

"No." He chuckled at her words as he slipped two fingers into her pussy. "Look at you, still soaking wet. Are you ever not ready for my dick?"

"No." She admitted with a shudder as he continued to play with her. He seemed to be considering her admission before he chuckled once again. It was crazy how he had been so angry not ten minutes ago when he had flogged and hate fucked her, and now he seemed so relaxed and amused by the situation.

"I think we have time for one more go before we have to get back. Get over here and ride my dick."

Tessa wearily pushed herself up and turned toward him. She found him sitting cross legged on the ground behind her, watching her expectantly. Tessa slid into his lap and straddled him, finding him already hard and ready for her. She swayed her hips and slid her pussy over him a few times, letting the anticipation build before she slowly lowered herself onto him. She was hyper sensitive from the previous pounding that she had taken and moaned with a toss of her head as he entered her. Still it felt so good.

Tessa placed her hands on his broad shoulders for balance as she began to move. She took it slow, too tired and sore to ride with abandon. But he was not complaining about the pace so she was not going to push it if he was letting her get away with it. Maybe he was tired too. She felt his hands drift down to her waist and urge her on before moving to cup her butt.

"Kiss me." His voice demanded in her ear as she bobbed along his length. Tessa sighed and brought her lips to his, her tongue exploding into his mouth.

For some reason, kissing him was more humiliating to her than anything else he did to her. Kissing was an act of intimacy. And being forced to do it with this man that she hated with every fiber in her being made the prideful woman in her want to draw the line. Still she did it, because he commanded.

"Not like that." He warned her as he gripped a handful of her hair and snapped her head back. "Not like a greedy slut. Kiss me like you wanted to when you first met me."

Tessa frowned but did as commanded. Gently she captured his lips and feathered soft, dainty kisses across them. She arched her back as she rode him, her breasts pressing into his chest and her hard nipples dragging across his skin. She sighed as she kissed him again and he grunted in response as his hands moved up and plunged into her thick hair. If anyone walked in on them now they wouldn't think that they were fucking. Her friends would see them making love and assume that the were "together". And the thought of it turned her stomach. Why was that so much more embarrassing for her than him fucking her in the ass and calling her a slut? For the millionth time she asked herself what the fuck was wrong with her.

Tessa let her tongue slip into his mouth again, but this time it wasn't forceful or needy. This time she kept it light as it licked along his teeth and gently caressed his own tongue. His teeth nipped at her lower lip but they did not hurt, they were almost playful. Was this how he treated the women he liked? Women that he was actually dating? Or was he always rough and forceful no matter who he was with?

Tessa pushed the questions out of her mind and rode him. No matter how it seemed, he was still forcing her to do it this way so he was still domineering and controlling, no matter what pretty facade was covering the dirty act. For some reason, that thought made her feel better. Tessa escaped into it as she tightened her pussy around him and squeezed. He moaned into her mouth and thrust up into her but the motion of his hips was limited by the weight of her body. So Tessa did the work for him and sped up her pace. Once again his hands cupped her ass and urged her to bounce. He wasn't hitting her this time and their warmth felt good against her beaten skin.

Soon Tessa felt that familiar fire rise up within her and felt herself building into an orgasm. And when it hit her she threw her head back and tossed her hair with gasp of surprise. She hadn't thought that she would be able to cum any more tonight, not with the punishment that she had taken. And while this wasn't as Earth shattering as most of her orgasms were with him, it still shocked her that it had been possible.

"Don't you dare stop until I cum." He warned her, his words bitten off and quaking. Tessa knew that it wouldn't be long. So she tightened her pussy around him every single time she moved her hips upward, only to released as she slid back down. Like that she rocked. Up and down. Squeeze and release. Soon she felt him strain upward as far as he could in this position as every muscle in his body locked. His arms tightened convulsively around her as his hands clamped around her ass, a broken groan hurtling from his lips as his cocked jerked inside of her.

Even once he was spent he clutched her possessively to his large body. Tessa had slumped in his arms, giving in to the needs of her exhausted body. It took him a few minutes to gather himself before he seemed to snap back to consciousness.

"Up." He directed as he lifted her out of his lap. "Get dressed. Time to go back."

Tessa nodded as she made her way over to the box where she had tossed her dress. Quickly she pulled it over her abused body and slipped into her shoes.

"Forgetting something?" His voice asked from behind her. Tessa turned to look behind her in confusion only to frown at what she found. He was holding the plug up and smirking at her. "Bend over."

Tessa sighed as she bent over the box where she had tossed her dress and braced her arms against it. He moved up to her and pushed her skirt up, one large had pressing into the small of her back as the other began to rub the butt plug in teasing circles around her asshole.

"I want you wearing this to the next party too." He informed her as he slowly began to insert it inside her. Tessa stiffened but took it. Finally it was nestled snuggly inside of her and he allowed her to straighten. "Do you remember who is hosting next time?"

"You." She whispered as she slowly turned back to face him.

"Why do you sound hesitant all of a sudden?" He chuckled as he gripped her chin with hard fingers and forced her to look at him. "Scared to step foot in my house?"

"Possibly." She admitted, even though he had just hit the nail on the head. He always had elaborate plans for her when they met up, including supplying his own toys and restraints. She couldn't imagine how the set up would be in his own house.

"A rabbit <em>should</em> be scared when entering a wolf's den." He smiled toothily at her. "But don't worry princess, we're going to have a great time. Now get going before your dumb-shit best friend gets suspicious that you've been gone too long."

"She's probably too busy fucking Michael to notice what I'm up to."

"Michael is boring and has no imagination. He considers doggy style to be wild. Trust me princess, we're having a much better time than those two. Plus, he's got a small dick."

"I'm pretty sure you have everyone beat there." She snorted in amusement.

"So you approve of my dick?" He asked with a grin.

"You know how I feel about your dick." She replied with a shrug. If he was looking for a compliment, he was going to have to force it out of her. But Quinn had never been shy about doing just that.

"Tell me." He demanded as he took a step toward her and grabbed a fistful her hair and pulled back hard on it.

"I love your dick." She whispered passed the awkward angle of her neck. "It's the biggest one I have every taken."

"Not even Jake?"

"Jake's nothing compared to you." She admitted. She had lost her virginity to Jake and she would always have a soft spot for him, but his dick was a fraction of the size of Quinn's, and he used it only half as well.

"So if you had to choose between Jake and me..."

"You." She admitted as she closed her eyes in shame. Jake had been nothing but a gentleman... kind, caring and compassionate, and equally so as a lover. He had treated her like a lady and taken care of her. So why would she run over Jake if that's what it took to get to Quinn? It was humiliating.

"Oh my fucked up princess." Quinn chuckled as he released her hair and gave her a shove toward the door. "Get your slut ass out of here before I lose control and have to bend you over and fuck you again."

Tessa almost wished that he would. Yet she moved toward the door and let herself out into the warm summer air once again and left him behind.

Tessa sat in the large dining room of Quinn's house, barely able to concentrate on the conversation around her. She was uncomfortable for a variety of reasons: she was in his home ... the plug would shift inside her every time she moved ... and he keep leering at her as if he knew something that she didn't. Take your pick. But it was his looks that worried her the most. He was definitely planning something. But he had yet to make a move.

Tessa had excused herself to go to the ladies room a few times and he had not followed her. And he had given her no instructions for when or where to meet him. Tessa was at a complete loss and she didn't like how it was making her feel.

"Tessa? Hey Tessa!" Kate's voice pulled her from her thoughts.

"Yes?" Tessa snapped back into herself and focused on her friend. "Sorry, did you say something?"

"What is wrong with you tonight?" Kate asked with a certain measure of concern in her voice. "You're distracted, you barely ate anything and you've only had one glass of wine. Are you ok?"

"Yes." Tessa sighed as she scrubbed tiredly at her head. Truth be told, she was feeling a little out of sorts but she couldn't tell if something was really wrong or if it was just the situation that was causing her stress. "I just feel a little off."

"Off?" Kate asked with a delicate raise of one brow.

"Maybe I should go splash some water on my face or something." Tessa said as she began to scoot her chair backward.

"I could come with you if you're not feeling well." Kate offered.

"I'm fine." Tessa assured her. "I've just been working a lot and not taking care of myself like I should. Besides, isn't Michael waiting for you in a guestroom or something?"

"Probably." Kate giggled with a glance over at Michael's empty seat. "Last time at Roger's house, he told me he had a present for me and told me to come find him. When I did, I found him waiting for me naked with a bow wrapped around his dick. Isn't that funny?"

"Hilarious." Tessa said as she stood. It was taking a lot of effort to move and she leaned heavily against the table once she was up.

"You might be getting sick." Kate said as she ran a speculative eye over her. "If so, and I say this with nothing but love, but ... stay the hell away from me. Michael is taking me to the Bahamas next week and the last thing I need is to be throwing up the whole time. Not sexy."

"Thanks for your concern." Tessa rolled her eyes as she pushed herself away from the table.

"Love you sis." Kate called after her with a laugh. Tessa didn't even bother to look behind her as she slipped out of the dining room. The hall beyond was quiet and dimly lit.

Tessa hadn't seen much of Quinn's house since she didn't want to sneak around and snoop through his things like he had done to her, but the parts of it she had seen were pretty swanky. It was one of the old, giant brick homes in the ritzy neighborhood downtown where the city's original mansions had been built in the 1940's before people had started building their McMasions in the rich areas of the suburbs. But, like her, Quinn worked downtown and probably wanted to be close to his job. She wasn't 100% sure what his job entailed but she had heard the world software engineer used. She knew what he did was a lot more than IT work. He designed software systems had had grown quite wealthy selling his work but Tessa had never really been into computers. Plus she didn't really care about what he did so she had never listened when he talked about it.

Right now, she didn't care about much of anything, let alone for what Quinn did for a living. Her head was beginning to grow fuzzy as her movements became more sluggish. She would have sworn that she was drunk, if she hadn't only had one glass of wine tonight. Maybe Kate was right. Maybe she was getting sick. Quinn was going to be pissed if she left before he got a chance to fuck her in his own house, but she couldn't control it if she was coming down with something. But that was a problem for later. She just wanted to make it to the bathroom. The hall around her was started to spin.

It seemed like it took an eternity but soon she found herself right outside the first-floor bathroom. Tessa slipped inside and leaned heavily against the sink in relief, bracing herself there with a moan. The world was warping around her, everything hazy and muddled.

The sound of the bathroom door opening distracted her from her growing misery. She looked up to find Quinn standing there ... or three of him, as it looked to her blurry eyes.

"No ... not tonight." Her voice came out slow, soft and slurred.

"You don't get to say no to me. That ship has sailed, princess." He chuckled as he slid up beside her. His large hand fell on either of her shoulders and forced her to face him. Tessa's own hands slipped up to grip his forearms as the floor tilted away from her.

"I think I'm sick." She informed him as she began to sway.

"Wrong, guess again." His laughter was mocking but Tessa barely noticed. The black spots that were beginning to float before her eyes suddenly doubled in size as she felt the floor finally drop away.

And with that, Tessa knew no more.

<p align="center">**********</p>

Tessa was floating, her mind detached from her body and drifting through darkness. Confusion filled her almost immediately and her eyes flew open to find ... nothing. Everything was still dark.

Tessa blinked her eyes furiously to try to bring them into focus but there was nothing. And now that she was a little more aware, she could feel something covering her eyes. Tessa moaned and tossed her head as she attempted to take stock of her body only to be immediately horrified by what she found.

She was laying on something soft and satiny -- a big bed with silk sheets, if she had to guess. But she could tell that she was completely naked and laying exposed to the room. Her hands and feet were all secured by what felt like leather cuffs, pulled tight and probably secured to the bedposts so that she was completely helpless with her legs spread wide open. Not only was a blindfold over her eyes but there was a gag in her mouth and something around her throat as well. But worst of all ... something long and hard was inside her pussy, held in place by a harness that had been strapped to her waist.

Tessa came fully awake at the realization and tried to call out, but the sound was muffled by the gag. She began to pull at her restraints but they had barely any give and she was only able to move a few inches.

What was the last thing she remembered?

She remembered talking to Kate at dinner, and then starting to feel strange. Tessa remembered the labored walk to the bathroom, then everything had started to spin ... and then ... Quinn. She remembered him standing before her before everything went dark.

He had done something to her. <em>Son of a bitch.</em>

Tessa felt anger overtake her as she gave her arms and legs and angry jerk. Nothing. Still she continued to wiggle and pull, hoping to find a weak spot in the restraints. She could not tell time here in the dark but it felt like at least ten minutes had passed before she heard a small sound at the foot of the bed.

Was someone there?

Tessa tried to cry out and demand to know who was there and what was going on, even though she already had a pretty good idea what the answer to both questions already was. But her words were muffled gibberish. And whoever was watching didn't seem to care about her distress.

Quinn.

Of course he wouldn't care, not when he was the one that had caused the distress to begin with.

Suddenly there was a strange sound from the foot of the bed before whatever was inside of her sprang to life. Tessa was horrified to realize that it was vibrator and Quinn had just turned to on remotely. He said not a word as he did it. The silence was torture to Tessa. But those concerns were pushed from her mind when she heard a couple of clicks from the end of the bed and the vibrator inside her increased in power. She could tell that it was pulsating and rotating as well, stretching her out and hitting all of her secret sweet spots.

Tessa threw her head back on the pillow with a groan as her toes pointed and every muscle in her body stretched itself tight. Another click -- and another increase in intensity from the vibrator. Tessa was panting now as she wiggled and squirmed. She was trying to fight it but the pleasure inside her was building. She was tied down so thoroughly without the ability to see or even speak, being fucked by an invisible device as he watched, all without knowing how she had even got into this situation. And never had she found anything so hot.

The vibrator was buzzing at a breakneck speed and Tessa could feel her juices flowing around it. She began to buck her hips, completely unable to control her body's own reaction to what was happening. Her moans came in time with her thrusts, each one more high and frantic than the last. And when she came, the orgasm ripped from her with a scream.

Tessa collapsed back down onto the bed and the vibrator shut off with an audible click. Yet she barely had a moment to recover before she felt hands on her. Even though she could not see who was touching her she knew that it was Quinn. She would know his hands anywhere, and not just from the callouses.

He was running his hands along her thighs, up her bell belly and over her breasts -- kneading and pulling before dipping down once again to repeat. After a few moments she felt the bed dip as the weight of a body climbed between her legs. The next thing she knew, his dexterous fingers were tugging on the harness at her waist. She felt it being unbuckled before the vibrator was pulled out of her body with a wet sound. Tessa moaned as it went but she had not a moment to adjust before his cock was there, it's bulbous head pressing into her wet folds.

Tessa tossed her head. She was already overwhelmed, she could not possibly take any more but Quinn ignored her. Without warning he shoved roughly into her, Tessa arching her back with a scream. He was laying above her now, his big body pushing her down to the mattress as he began to fuck her. His huge dick ran in and out of the tight channel of her pussy, his pelvis ramming into her with every powerful thrust.

They had not met up this month and he had not called or demanded that she make any dirty videos for him. Pictures and video clips had still shown up on her phone at random intervals but other than that, he had left her alone and right now, it showed. He apparently had some tension to work off.

He was not making any noise as he fucked her. It was quite disconcerting. Since she was blindfolded it could have been anyone between her legs. He had probably wanted her disoriented. But she knew every inch of him, including how his cock felt inside her. That enormous member couldn't belong to anyone but him.

Quinn began to speed up, his hips moving like pistons as they slammed into her. Tessa moaned and cried out with every thrust, her boobs jumping as their skin obscenely slapped together. Tessa had always secretly loved the sound. And when he finally came he pulled her hair so hard that it felt like he was about to break her neck.

When he was done he collapsed down on top of her and Tessa could barely breathe passed his massive weight. He seemed content to lay there for an eternity, the muscles in his body twitching as his dick slowly started to grow limp inside of her.

"Hello princess." He finally murmured into her ear after several minutes of laying bonelessly on top of her. "Feeling better?"

"Mmmm..." Tessa moaned into the gag as she flexed her fingers.

"Do you have something to say?" He laughed as his fingers slipped under the gag and pulled it out of her mouth.

"What is going on?" She instantly demanded, her voice quivering with anger. "What the fuck did you do to me?"

"I drugged your wine." He informed her with a chuckle.

"What the fuck? Why?!"

"Because I could." He shrugged.

"Kate knows I wasn't feeling good. She's going to be worried about me."

"That's why I sent her a text message from your phone telling her that you were really sick and leaving the party early." He informed her.

"You went into my phone?" Tessa gasped.

"I've been looking through it while you've been out." He informed her. "Just making sure you were following my rules and not seeing any other guys. I was pleased to find that you saved some of the pictures that I sent you. Do you touch yourself when you look at them?"

"How long have I been unconscious?" She demanded, ignoring his question.

"A few hours." He replied.

"What?!"

"I moved your car into my garage so everyone thinks you just left early. No one even thought to come looking for you in my house. They all left an hour ago. You're completely alone with me, princess. You and me, we're going to have a great weekend together."

"No!" Tessa gasped. "I can't stay here all weekend!"

"You don't have a choice." Quinn laughed at her distress. "Don't worry. I'll have you back to work by Monday."

"You can't drug me and keep me in your house! That's kidnapping!"

"Exactly."

"Quinn..."

"You're not allowed to call me by name." His jovial tone was gone, only to be replaced by a snarl as he reached up and closed his fingers around her throat. "That one was free, because this is new for you. You're upset right now so you probably just forgot, but the next one will cost you a piece of your ass. Got it?"

"Yes." Tessa wheezed passed the pressure in her throat.

"Yes what?!" He demanded with a growl.

"Yes Master." She moaned.

"Good whore." He chuckled as he reached down and gave her nipple a firm pinch. "Don't worry about anyone looking for you. Judging by your text history, the only one that even cares about you is Kate. If she texts you, I'll tell her you're feeling better and not to worry."

"But I don't want to stay here all weekend."

"I really don't give a shit what you want." Quinn chuckled as he finally pulled his limp dick out of her with a groan. And before she could protest he had shoved the gag back into her mouth and secured the strap around her head. "Get comfy princess. You're going to be here for as long as it takes for you to realize I'm the boss and I set the rules. You're only job is to obey."

Tessa tried to toss her head and cry for him to come back as he pushed himself off the bed. But he was not listening. Tessa heard his footsteps retreat across the room before a door slammed and there was silence.

Tessa pulled at the straps and tried to find a weakness but there was none. She was trapped.

Anger flared brightly through her as she called every curse after him that she could think of, even though they sounded liked muffled garbles of sound due to the gag. Still, she knew what they meant and right now that was enough.

Finally she gave up and collapsed back down to the bed with an angry screech. There was nothing she could do. She was trapped. And he was right that no one would miss her this weekend. Kate might check up over text but Quinn could easily pretend to be her and answer. No one else would even notice that she was missing. Maybe she needed to befriend some of her neighbors ... but even then, what was the point of that? Even if anyone knew that she was missing and somehow found her at Quinn's house, it would be humiliating and then everyone would know what she had been up to for all of these months. But the thought of staying here for the next two days made her stomach tense up, and not in a good way. She could barely get through an hour with him without feeling like she was about to come apart at the seams. How would she feel after 48? The thought was unfathomable. She couldn't even wrap her mind around it.

Tessa lost track of time as she laid there, her mind buzzing and whirling from the possibilities. Laying like this in the darkness of the blindfold, bound and gagged, with no entertainment or sense of time was an exquisite torture. It felt like hours to her, but could have been a fraction of that for all she knew. She was aware that she fell asleep for a while before she jerked awake, crying out in fear and confusion before she remembered where she was and what had happened. She had only been able to gasp for air against the gag as her heartbeat slowly began to return to normal. After that she had tried to count the seconds and had made it up to fifteen minutes worth but had lost count after that and gave up.

Tessa felt like she had been laying there for an eternity before a small sound at the door sent her head snapping up.

"Miss me?" Quinn laughed at her reaction.

"Asshole!" Tessa to scream through the gag but it came out more like a muffled "Aff-ol". Still he understood and chuckled at her distress.

"That wasn't a very nice word to call your master." Quinn tisked as he moved up to her and landed a sharp slap against her tits. "Do you want to make me punish you so soon into our time together? It might make the rest of the weekend uncomfortable for you."

That settled Tessa in an instant. Some of the times, his punishments her were simply foreplay to her -- like the times that he had spanked her with the hairbrush and the paddle. But the flogger and belt had both done some damage and it had taken her days curled on her couch to recover. She wouldn't be able to do that here.

"Good choice." He chuckled at how easily she gave up her defiance. She felt him at the end of the bed, his fingers unlocking her from the restraints. Tessa moaned and flexed her cramped legs as he moved up to her hands. But even once he had freed her, the cuffs remained.

Tessa sat up and he yanked the blindfold off her eyes and the gag out of her mouth and she took her first look around his bedroom. It was large but dark, everything decorated in charcoal, grey and black. The windows were shuttered and the only light in the room was from the flickering light of warm LED candles in holders interspersed throughout the room. But it was not his decorating choices that stopped her cold, it was the various "toys" that she could see around the room. There were tables and chairs with straps and chains, strange furniture that she could tell were meant to hold down a body, a large wooden X on one wall with hooks on all four arms, chains hanging from the ceiling, and a huge shelf full of various sex toys and BDSM equipment.

"All for you princess." He informed her as she looked around the room in shock. "I had a few things already but not many chicks I ever fucked were into this like you. But you ... you are the biggest pain slut that I have ever met. I've done a lot to prepare for the day I would get you in my house. We're going to have a very good time this weekend."

"I don't want to be here for that long." She whispered as she turned her huge eyes up to him.

"Scared?" He asked her with a smile. "You should be. But be a good girl and make me happy and I'll only hurt you a little."

Tessa shivered at his words and looked down at her hands. There she found two padded leather cuffs looped around her wrists with matching ones on her ankles with metal loops built into them for attaching chains. They were all secured closed with a small gold locks and she knew that he probably had the key hidden somewhere safely away from her. Next her fingers drifted up to touch the unfamiliar pressure around her throat. It was a collar and Tessa found another lock and loop, just like the cuffs.

"Those will only come off when it's time to go home." He informed her almost gleefully. "Stand up."

Tessa did as instructed, swaying slightly as she got her feet under her. Her muscles were abused and a few short hours ago she had been drugged. She was lucky to be on her feet at all.

"There's a bathroom over there." He said as he tipped his head at it. "Go take care of whatever you need to."

Slowly Tessa started to shuffle toward it. At least he wasn't going to make her suffer the humiliation of asking his permission to piss. She half expected him to demand that she leave the door open but didn't. Apparently not even he would go that far. But she was annoyed to find no lock on the door. He probably wouldn't let her stay in here very long by herself without barging in.

Quickly Tessa took care of the needs of her body before she moved to the sink and washed her hands. The woman that stared back at her from the mirror was not someone that she recognized. Pale with wild hair framing a sober face, wearing cuffs and a collar.

Tessa sighed in resignation as she dried off her hands and turned to face the door once again. Her fingers shook as she reached for the handle and she forced herself to take a deep breath and pull it open. But there she hesitated as she stared out of the room at Quinn. He was messing with a video camera at the end of the bed. She had noticed it when she had taken off the blindfold and had assumed that it had been recording her already tonight. But he was now spending a lot of time positioning it just right at the foot of the bed.

"Get over here my pretty little whore." He rumbled at her, not even bothering to look up at her. Tessa stepped away from the bathroom and slowly made her way over the bed. "Sit."

He had tipped his head at the end of the bed and Tessa perched lightly there. Finally he moved over to her and reached for her, his hands hooking beneath her knees and pulling her forward until she rested right on the edge of the bed. Next he forced her knees open as wide as they would go while urging her to balance on the balls of her feet. He guided her hands behind her to lean back slightly on the bed while positioning her back so it was arched with her breasts thrust outward as her hair cascaded down her back like a soft, brown waterfall.

"Don't move." He warned her as he moved back over to the camera and pressed play. Once it was recording he scooped up a very expensive looking photography camera and aimed it at her.

Tessa settled her eyes straight forward as he began to snap pictures. She wondered how many of these she would be receiving on her phone in the coming weeks.

He took pictures of everything ... full length from straight ahead and her profile as well as close ups of her face, breasts and pussy. They were all pretty tame compared to the hard core things he had sent her in the past but for some reason this was more humiliating -- forcing her to submit to an intimate photo shoot.

Finally he seemed satisfied and set his camera aside. She had a feeling he was not done with it for the weekend, but for now, he was moving on to other activities.

Tessa could see his cock sticking out from between his legs, hard and throbbing. He was moving slowly toward her now and did not stop until he came to rest between her legs. She was still sitting with them splayed wide open, just as he had posed her. Tessa did not dare move her body, but tilted her head a little to peer up at him.

"You want me to fuck you, don't you?" He asked as his hand moved toward her face. Tessa stiffened but he did not smack her like she had been expecting. Instead he pushed her hair away from her face so he could see her better.

"Yes." She admitted through gritted teeth. Damn him. And damn herself, because it was true. Her pussy was already tingling just from having him stand so close to her. She despised him, but craved him at the same time and hated that she had no control over it.

"After everything I have done to you, you still can't get enough of my cock. Why is that?"

"I don't know." Tessa admitted. Maybe that was a question for a therapist, not that she would ever attempt to get help for this particular problem. Not when she would have to describe to a stranger what that problem even was. Therapist or not, she would never tell anyone what she allowed Quinn to do to her.

"I know why I love doing what I do to you. Hell, it makes sense." He snorted with amusement. "Since I was sixteen, I had fantasies of making you pay. Of owning and humiliating you because of the shit we used to do to each other."

"So you admit that it was mutual?" She asked, her voice hard. He had put the blame squarely on her since the day it had started and it was not fair of him. But she had done the same. Maybe it was time to admit that they had both had an equal hand in the ugliness of their past.

"Perhaps." Quinn shrugged. "It's not going to stop me from taking it out of your ass every chance I get. But I just don't understand why you let me do it. If you hate me as much as I think you do, why did you even let me touch you? You could have said no to me that first time."

Deep down, Tessa knew that she still could. When they were in the middle of it like they were now, he didn't care what she had to say. She could scream no and beg for mercy and he would still do whatever he wanted to her. But in between their sessions, if she chose to never go back to him, he would not retaliate. He'd be pissed, but he would back off. She knew that all his big talk about blackmail was just that -- big talk. But she kept coming back every time. And there was a part of her that knew she always would unless they both grew tired of using each other like this.

"I told you, I don't know." Tessa sounded exasperated now. She should hate him ... she <em>did</em> hate him, but she wanted him. Even when she was living her normal life -- working, cooking dinner, watching movies, reading a good book -- it didn't matter. He was always on the fringes of her thoughts.

"But you do still want me, don't you?" He prompted as he took another step into her. His cock was just ghosting over her pussy lips now, teasing her. His hand had slipped behind her neck to hold her head still. Her face was tilted up to him, their eyes locked.

"Yes." She breathed, utterly transfixed and unable to look away.

"What do you want?"

"I want your cock inside me. Over and over." She whispered.

"Then take it." Was all he said before he thrust his hips forward and slid into her, his eyes never breaking contact with hers.

Tessa stiffened with a gasp as her entire body convulsed. The way that he had positioned the camera would capture the perfect angle of his dick sliding in and out of her pussy and Tessa tingled at the thought of the images that he was capturing.

She was still holding her legs wide open for him, granting him unimpeded access to her pussy and it allowed him to go deeper than he ever had before. Tessa gasped with each of his long thrusts. He was moving slowly as he drew back but would then thrust forcefully back into her. Her entire body would jolt every single time and send tiny whimpers of pleasure escaping her. He was still holding her head and his hand shifted to ball into the back of her hair at the nape of her neck. Her head was forced backward and it made her back arch even more. Her breasts were jumping every time he slammed into her and her hard, dark nipples were on full display for the camera. He was staring down at her as he fucked her, watching her face carefully. Tessa realized that he wanted to watch her face as she came. She found that she could not look at him in the eyes any longer and allowed her own eyes to drift shut as she concentrated on the sensations flooding her body. But Quinn immediately corrected her.

"Look at me." He demanded, his voice guttural as he continued to thrust into her. Tessa let out another long whimper but did as commanded. She forced herself to meet his eyes and found an almost animalistic hunger in his blue depths.

Quinn's face was tight and his jaw was gritted. He looked almost wild as he fucked her. And now that he had eye contact with her yet again, it spurred him to move faster. His hips began to slam into her with urgency. He was pulling almost out of her before thrusting all the way back inside, bottoming out every time. Tessa felt so full. His dick moving inside of her was like a force of nature. Her breathing was speeding up now, her small, labored gasps turning into high moans of pleasure as her orgasm began to build. And when it exploded within her, she watched his hungry eyes grow positively feral. His pace picked up again as her clenched pussy slowly began to relax until he was all but slamming into her with wild abandon. Tessa dared not break eye contact, and saw it the moment his own orgasm took hold. He buried himself inside of her with a growl as he shot hot loads of cum inside of her.

"You milked me dry." He gasped as his entire body slumped. Tessa said nothing, merely let her eyes slide back shut now that the moment was over. Her head lolled backward as she panted, her breasts now crushed to his chest as he leaned against her. He took a few moments to gather his strength before he pulled out of her. Tessa could not help herself and tightened her strong pussy walls around him as he tried to leave her depths. He groaned as she squeezed him, truly "milking" him as he left her.

"Holy shit girl..." He gasped as he looked down at her in surprise. Tessa merely smirked at the look on his face. He might have all the power, but she could still exert some control. "I'll get you back for that ... later."

As he said it he moved over to the camera and stopped the recording before turning back to her and pointing to the head of the bed.

"Scoot." He commanded her.

Tessa did as told and scooted backward until she came to rest in a nest of pillows. He rounded the bed and began to climb in beside her. Still he took the time to grab a sturdy chain hanging from the headboard and attached it to her collar. It was long so she could move, but not long enough to let her leave the bed.

"Just in case you get the bright idea of trying to leave once I'm asleep." He informed her as he settled into the bed and pulled her against him. Tessa stiffened in his arms. This was the first time that they would truly be 'sleeping' together, in the literal definition of the word. Out of everything that he had ever demanded of her, this made her truly uncomfortable.

"Relax." He rumbled in her ear as he spooned her, holding her tightly to his body. "We've got two days together and you've got to sleep sometime. I sure as shit ain't giving you your own room so you're just going to have to get used to this."

Despite his words, she remained stiff against him. That seemed to be all he wanted to say on the subject and let silence fall over them. It didn't take long before his muscles began to twitch as sleep overtook him. Tessa was not so lucky.

There she lay in his big beg, trapped in the cage of his arms while the chain ensured that she would not be able to go anywhere even if he relaxed his grip. Despite her discomfort and anger over the situation, the exhaustion filling her body began to get the best of her. She managed to fight it for another twenty minutes before she began to drift away, the darkness folding over her to take her away.

<p align="center">**********</p>

Tessa woke with a gasp to a sharp pain in her chest. She jerked and swatted at whatever had bitten her only to find a large hand where she has expected to find some sort of biting insect.

"Wakey wakey." Quinn chuckled as he gave her nipple another brutal pinch.

"Stop!" Tessa gasped as she tried to swat his hand away.

"This ain't the Ritz, princess. No gentle wake up calls here. Time to get up."

"What time is it even?" She grumbled in annoyance as she cast a glance at the windows. The blinds were still pulled tightly over them so there was no way to gauge the time of day but she got the impression that it was fairly late at night.

"Time for you to suck my dick." He chuckled as he pulled her across the bed. Tessa cried out in surprise as he shoved her down to the mattress and flipped her onto her back while simultaneously dragging her toward the edge of the bed. The chain was pulled tight but it still had enough length for her head to dangle backward over the side of the bed while the rest of her body lay horizontally across it, tits up. Before she could even get her bearings, he was pushing his dick into her mouth. Tessa's mouth was forced wide and she took him into her throat at an awkward angle. Immediately she choked and gagged. Tessa tried to push him away from her, her hands slapping at his muscular thighs but he was relentless.

"Fucking take it, you whore." He growled at her as he tried to push himself further into her throat. Tessa bucked him off and pulled her head away, Quinn growling in anger at her defiance.

"I can't do it!" She gasped in fear. "This angle is too deep. It's choking me."

"Good." Was all Quinn growled as he shoved his cock back into her mouth. Once again she choked and sputtered, her entire body spasming as she tried to pull her head away. Fear made her heart beat like a frightened bird within her.

"No!" Tessa cried out as she once again managed to pull her face away from him. "Let me do it normally, please. I'll suck it so good..."

"Shut up and do what you're told." Quinn snarled down at her. "This is your last warning."

"I can't!" She snapped at him with growing anger. His eyes narrowed dangerously at her reaction as he grew still above her. Tessa was too relieved to be scared by the look on his face.

"Have it your way." Was all he said as he moved over a nearby shelf. When he returned he was gripping a key and quickly unlocked the chain from her collar. He said not a word as he pulled her from the bed. Tessa was dragged across the room toward the huge wooden X against the far wall. Once there, he shoved her up against it with her back to the room and used his big body to hold her immobile while he guided the first of her hands upward. He snapped the loop on her cuff into a spring lock before doing the same with her other hand. Next her feet received the same treatment. When he was done, she was left standing upright with her arms and legs spread eagle. He moved away from her toward the wall of toys and Tessa tried to crane her neck to watch him but he was directly behind her.

"You brought this on yourself." He informed her as he moved back behind her. "But don't worry princess, this should be a walk in the park after last time."

And without another word he slapped her ass with something firm that hit with an audible twack and stung her ass cheeks. Tessa stiffened and cried out in surprise.

"This is called a Scottish Tawse." Quinn informed her as he struck her again. Tessa stiffened with a hiss even as she felt her nipples spring to life and press into the hard wood before her as warmth spread through her belly. He was right. Compared to the flogger, the blows were deliciously sinful and sent pleasure and pain racing through her in equal parts. Tessa cried out with every blow and he seemed to be enjoying the sound of it. When they were at a dinner party, he had to gag her so her cries would not alert the others but here in the privacy of his own house he could enjoy the sound of them.

Tessa lost count of the blows as he punished her ass. But she knew that it was upwards of twenty before he finally began to slow. When he was finally done he threw the device on the ground beside her and Tessa was finally able to see what he had been hitting her with. It looked like a sturdy leather strap that had been slit into two tails.

"That left some pretty marks." Quinn breathed as he moved up behind her and massaged her red skin. Tessa moaned and melted into him as the fire in her belly grew.

"God damn it girl, that was supposed to be a punishment, not get you off." Quinn said as he reached around her and dipped his fingers into her pussy. He pulled them out and found them to be soaking wet. He said nothing as he shoved them into her mouth, moving them slowly in and out of her lips as she sucked them clean.

"Apparently, you still have a lesson to learn." Quinn informed her as he began to unhook her arms and legs. Once she was free, he wrapped his arms around her and turned to survey the room. He seemed to be thinking about his options before his eyes fell on a device nearby. Quinn laughed almost gleefully as he led her over to it.

It was a padded leather sex chair with straps for every conceivable surface. He shoved her into it and strapped her torso down before securing her arms so that they were stretched out to her sides. Next he guided her legs up onto the padded leg rests and strapped them down. Immediately Tessa was reminded of being in the stirrups at the OBGYN's office, except her doctor didn't have kinky straps to hold her body down.

Quinn disappeared for a moment before he appeared back at her side, once again setting up the video camera and started recording to capture the action. He then moved between her legs and set up the wildest device that she had ever seen. It was a dildo attached to some sort of machine and he positioned it so that it was pressing right into the lips of her pussy. Tessa realized that it was a sex machine that, once turned on, would automatically fuck her with the dildo. Quinn gave her a moment to realized what was about to happen before he pushed it into her and turned it on. Tessa's body stiffened with a gasp as the dildo began to pump in and out of her wet pussy. Her body jerked on the table as the machine fucked her, it's strokes as hard and uncaring as Quinn's. He stood above her, watching her for a moment as she filtered through shock and denial.

"I'm not done with you." He informed her as he moved toward her head. He reached down and adjusted something underneath the chair and the next thing she knew her head was being lowered backward.

"No..."Tessa moaned as he put her in the exact same position she had been on the bed, except this time he strapped her head down so she couldn't pull away from him.

"You're going to take my cock in your pretty mouth and let me fuck your throat." He warned her as he moved his hips forward to rub the tip of his cock against her cheeks. "If you continue to fight me I will put a gag ring on you to hold your mouth open and fuck your throat anyway. And when I'm done, I will get a cane and beat your ass so hard you won't be able to walk. You'll have to crawl at my feet all weekend. Are you going to do as you're told?"

"Yes ... Master." Tessa moaned. Her body was continuing to jolt forward every time the dildo slammed into her, her tits bouncing with every blow. But her head remained steady thanks to the strap.

"Open your mouth." Quinn commanded.

Tessa had no choice and obeyed. He automatically slid into her with groan and Tessa fought her gag reflex. Fear gripped her tightly and sent her heart pounding within her chest as her air was cut off.

"That's a good whore." Quinn grit his teeth tightly against the feel of it as he began to move. At this angle he bottomed out every single time, his enormous dick shoved so far down her throat that it brought tears to her eyes. His balls rested against her forehead for a moment before he drew back for another pump. Tessa took a desperate gasp of air while she still could before he thrust back into her. Like that he began to fuck her mouth, in and out, deep and long, as Tessa fought not to gag or pass out. All the while the dildo continued to drill into her pussy and make her body jump. Quinn was leaning over her now, his large hands reaching down to cup her breasts and squeeze her hard with every thrust.

"I knew you could take this dick." His voice shook from the sensations wracking him. "That's a good slave."

His hips were working fast now, his hands tightening convulsively around her breasts as he worked at her mouth. His balls slapped against her face and she squeezed her eyes shut against their onslaught. Too much was happening and her brain could not process it. Strapped to a table with her head hanging upside down with a large dildo hammering her pussy while he drilled into her mouth and blinded her with his balls. It was too much.

Tessa began to moan and Quinn shuddered in pleasure at the sound. But her moans were not from pleasure. Discomfort, fear and humiliation all gripped her. If this had been a normal BDSM relationship, she would have been screaming her safe word the second he lowered her head down. But nothing about this was normal. This was not a relationship, this was an ownership, and she had willingly entered into it.

His thrusts were growing almost frantic now and he groaned and moaned above her like a wild thing. She breathed when she could but he was staying deeper for longer and it terrified her. Suddenly he rammed his hips forward with a ferocious howl and came deep in her throat. He stayed locked there for an eternity and Tessa felt fear grip her tightly as she began to see spots. There was no way to push him off or pull her head away, no way to make a sound and let him know she was in distress. But he was probably already aware of it and wanted her that way. Just when she thought that her lungs were going to burst he pulled out of her with a satisfied groan. Tessa gasped for air, her body spasming and gagging. She was not able to keep his cum in her throat from her body's violent reaction and coughed it up where it splashed against her face and dribbled down to the floor.

"God, you look good like that." Quinn chuckled from above her. He was bracing himself with his hands on either side of her torso as he peered down at her upside-down face. But as soon as he recovered from the orgasm he pushed himself away from her and moved further into the bedroom. When he returned a moment later he had his trusty camera with him. Tessa had no choice but to suffer through the indignation of more pictures, all the while the dildo kept thrusting into her pussy. It rocked her body forward with every hit as it filled her so completely.

"Please take it out." She finally forced herself to say.

"That wouldn't be fair of me." Quinn chuckled as he reached beneath her head and lifted the support back up and locked it into place so she was once again laying flat on the table. He even removed the strap for her so she could move her head again before he slipped down next to the machine. She had thought that he was going to turn it off but stiffened when she felt him squirt lube over her pussy. She hadn't been enjoying herself and therefor hadn't been very wet. But now the dildo began to easily slide in and out of her.

"I got off, it's only fair that you do too." Quinn informed her.

"I can't." She moaned. She was so far away from an orgasm that the thought was almost laughable.

"You're gonna. You're not getting up until you cum." As he said it his hand drifted down to her pussy and began to rub circles into her clit above the dildo. "You might as well relax and enjoy yourself."

His fingers were firm, their callouses scraping blissfully along her exposed nub. Tessa tried to do as he instructed. She believed him when he said that he would not release her until she came. He would let the dildo ram into her hours if needed. But getting herself out of the headspace she had just been in was no small task. So she let her eyes drift shut as she tried to take herself someplace else. In her mind she was not strapped to a table being fucked by a machine. Instead she was in a big beg, Quinn above her, rough and needy.

"That's it princess, just relax." Quinn purred as the tension drained from her body. She felt his free hand move to her breasts, altering through gentle caresses to hard pinches and firm slaps. "You like that, don't you?"

"Yes." The word came out a hiss as she tried to arch her back and press her tits up into his hand.

"Such a dirty girl." He breathed as he slapped her left breast, sending it bouncing. "You have the nicest tits I've ever seen."

Tessa found herself proud of that fact. They weren't giant tits like Kate's, but they were firm and round and perky. Large enough to fill Quinn's hands but not too big to be ridiculous. And the fact that Quinn liked them made her happy. It was a strange realization. It sent warmth flooding her belly and electricity racing to her pussy.

"There it is." Quinn grinned as she moaned. His fingers increased their pressure on her clit and rubbed warm, rough circles there, just like she liked. All the while the dildo dove in and out of her warm center. Tessa's breathing began to speed up, her body tensing as she felt the orgasm building. And when it exploded she threw her head back with a scream. Finally she collapsed bonelessly in her restraints and let her head roll to the side.

"Good girl." Quinn chuckled as he gave her nipple one last parting squeeze before moving to turn the machine off. Tessa sighed in the relief the moment it was pulled from her pussy. Next he set about freeing her from her restraints. Tessa tried to push herself up but was only able to sit up with the aid of his large hands. He didn't seem to mind. He actually seemed amused by her weakness.

"Go get yourself cleaned up." Quinn said as he pointed at the bathroom. Slowly Tessa slid from the restraint chair and forced herself to stand. She swayed for a moment before she got her feet back under her and began her slow trek across the room. She was happy when she slipped into the quiet solitude of the bathroom and turned on the water.

They were barely through night one and that had been some of the wildest sex that she had ever had. She could only imagine what he had in store for her for the rest of the weekend. And despite the abuse that her pussy had just taken, it woke up and tingled at the thought.

"You're so fucked up." Tessa informed herself in the mirror before she splashed water on her face and began to wash away his cum.

She had a feeling that "fucked up" was actually a pretty mild way to describe her behavior, but Tessa had no idea what phrase would even fit. So she refused to think about it and turned her attention to washing up. It was the only thing that she could control right now.

<p align="center">**********</p>

Tessa sat in the warmth of Quinn's in ground hot tub, letting the bubbles wash over and around her. Today was Sunday and they had been outside for most of the day. He had a lovely backyard with a small pool and hot tub and the weather had been pristine. So after lunch he had brought her out here, still naked except for her cuffs and collar. They were going to leave strange tan lines on her in this sun and she would have to wear turtle necks and long sleeves until she could even them out. Not an appealing thought in the summer. She wondered if any of his neighbors could see them out here but he seemed unconcerned about it and had fucked her on almost every piece of patio furniture that he owned.

Now the day was growing short and she knew that she was only hours away from being released from his house to return to her normal life. She had thought that she would hate spending two days with him and his relentless sexual appetites but now that it was almost time to leave, she was a little disappointed. It had been nice to just exist for a weekend without any stress or expectations. No deadlines, no bosses, no courtrooms or massive workload. No house to maintain or bills to pay. Just fucking on his whim. Existing just for pleasure and living in the moment. He was still hard and rough and dominated her every chance that he got but Tessa had found that she loved every minute of it. And outside of the sex, he took care of her needs. He made sure that she had time to bathe and rest, and kept her well fed with delicious meals while she was here. She hadn't wanted for anything this entire weekend. It would be strange to go back home to her usual frozen dinners that she ate in the short breaks she got while researching and prepping for her rather heavy work load.

"Your tits look nice in the bubbles." Quinn's voice pulled her from her tumbling thoughts.

"Thanks." She replied dryly as she rolled her head to look up at the stars.

"Get me more champagne." He demanded as he waived his arm at the tray he had positioned away from the water. Tessa did not argue. She merely pushed herself up onto her knees and rolled over onto her stomach, straining to reach the nearby bottle and glasses. She had just managed to snag the tray and drag it toward her when his gruff voice stopped her. "Wait, don't move."

Tessa froze at his words. Her legs were still submersed in the water up to her thighs, but her upper half was stretched out of the water and draped over the side of the hot tub.

Tessa heard a ripple in the water and knew that he was moving toward her. Tessa's gut immediately tensed at the feel of his body coming to rest so close behind her. After that first night in the chair, she had stopped fighting him. Her body was his and she fucked and sucked and rode him on command. And she had been so much better off for it. She had never cum so much in her life as she had this weekend.

Tessa felt his knees urging her legs open and she spread herself to him. She could feel his eyes on her, his gaze intense as he ran his hands over her butt and thighs. His skin had been warmed by the water and felt like fire when he touched her.

"I'll never get tired of this." He rumbled as he gave her ass a firm slap. Tessa moaned with abandon at the sharp sting of delightful pain. "I should keep you here forever."

Another slap, another moan. This time Tessa's inside's tensed at his words. It was all well and good to play like this for a weekend, but she did have a life to get back to. He couldn't be serious.

But the thoughts were wiped from her mind a moment later when a brand new sensation rocked her for the first time. He had bent over behind her and she was shocked to feel his mouth on her pussy. Tessa cried out in surprise as every muscle in her body locked as one. He licked and sucked at her warm pussy lips, his thick tongue darting out to push inside of her.

"You taste so good." He rumbled as he lapped at her. Tessa mewled like a kitten as she pressed her hips back into his face. He only laughed at her reaction. "Do you like that?"

"Yes." She moaned as he began to flick his tongue over her clit, hard and quick. The sensations were too new and it was quickly driving her over the edge. And when she came it was with a primal scream as her back arced and her hips bucked.

"You're such a whore. You came so fast." He chuckled as he pushed himself back up behind her and guided his cock between her legs. But he did not put it inside of her. Instead he pressed her legs together so that he was trapped between her thighs and slowly began to grind into her warm flesh. "Do you want me to fuck you?"

"Yes!" She cried out in frustration, her pussy throbbing in time with the blood that rushed between her ears.

"I'll let you decide how you want it this time. In the pussy or in the ass?" He informed her.

"Pussy!" She was quick to cry as every cell in her body vibrated in time with him. She was beginning to love being fucked in the ass by him but right now she was convinced that she would not stand another minute without feeling him pound her pussy like a drum. "Please Master, fuck my pussy!"

"Why?" He asked with a chuckle.

"Because I need you inside of me. I need you to own me!"

"Like this?" He asked sweetly as one hand reached down lightning quick and grabbed her right wrist. He wrenched it up behind her back and Tessa cried out with simultaneous pain and pleasure as he slammed his dick into her.

"Yes!" She moaned as she writhed beneath him.

"You like to be owed?" He asked her as he began to thrust.

"Only by you." Her voice was breathless as she laid beneath him. He kept her wrist pressed into the small of her back and her legs pinned by his massive thighs as he dove into her. All she could do was lay there and take it, her hips wiggling only when he allowed her an inch of two to move.

"This is <em>my</em> pussy." He growled as he slammed into her.

"Yes Master!" She cried as she felt him shift, one foot lifting up to plant itself onto the seat of the hot tub for leverage. Tessa lost herself to the pound of his cock within her. The rough concrete scraped over her stomach and tits as he pounded into her, her screams mingling with his growls to rise into the night air. Hopefully the other houses were far enough away that they would not hear them but at the moment, Tessa didn't care. All that mattered was the agony and ecstasy that filled her at the slap of their skin. Water splashed around them, the heated droplets in contrast with the cool night air.

Quinn's hand left her wrist and balled into her hair and Tessa felt her head being wrenched upward and back. Her back arched and he kept a firm grip on her hair as he continued to fuck her from behind. Her tits bounced wildly in front of her as she used her hands on the ground as balance. Suddenly his free hand slapped her ass, so hard that she knew it was going to leave a mark. Still Tessa cried out in pleasure.

"There's my fucked up princess." He moaned as he pounded into her, slapping her ass in time with the beat of his hips.

Tessa was coming undone. Her cries grew high and shrill as her own hips rocked violently back to meet him. Together they came, Tessa tightening around him with a scream as he sprayed himself into her depths. And when it was over they both collapsed against the side of the tub and lay in a tangled pile, his large cock still buried inside of her. Tessa strained to breathe passed his enormous weight but if he cared that she was struggling, he did not show it. Instead he panted above her, one hand still tangled in her hair and the other laying flat across her ass. He did not release his hold on her even when he began to move. He merely shifted his grip and pulled her with him as he moved backward across the hot tub. His dick slid from inside of her as his arms wrapped around her torso and pulled her into his lap. There she sat with her back pressed into his chest, her head resting on his shoulder as she stared up at the dark sky above. The warm water surrounded them now as his hands moved to play with her breasts. He was not going it for the sexual gratification of either of them. Instead, it was more of an absent gesture, like one might play with their hair while they were thinking.

"How long have we been fucking?" He asked her after a moment of thought. "A couple of months?"

"Four months." Her mind tallied the monthly dinner parties they had attended together since that first time they had fucked in secret at Michael's house.

"No shit?" He chuckled at her answer. "That's the longest I've stayed with any one bitch."

"That's because this isn't real. It's just sex." She replied.

"True." Ne nodded. "No relationships with dates and flowers and phone calls. All the stupid shit I hate. Just endless fucking. And I get to make the girl I've always hated scream for me."

"You're a pig." She growled in anger at his words.

"And you're a slut that let's me fuck you." He reminded her as he gave her nipple a hard twist. She grimaced at his words even as a soft gasp of pleasure ripped from her at the pinch. "Jesus Christ, you're such a whore."

"You don't want a lady." Was all she said.

"True." He nodded before he shoved her off of his lap. "Get out of the tub."

Tessa followed his pointing finger to where he had set up a table of toys. With resignation she began to climb out of the tub. Water rolled off of her in fat droplets and splashed across the patio as steam curled away from her body. Tessa turned to look back at him, finding him lounging in the hot top right where she had left him. That meant that he wanted her to perform for him. It would not be the first time this weekend that he had made her fuck herself while he watched.

"Get the dildo and a lock and come here." He instructed. Tessa did as ordered, positioning the suction cup of the dildo on one of the ceramic tiles near the hot tub as he directed before she moved over to him and let him secure the lock to the cuffs on her wrists with her hands behind her back. He took a few moments to finger her pussy and clit, making sure she was good and wet, before he tilted his head at the dildo. Tessa moved over to it without a word and carefully knelt above it.

"Look at me." He instructed as her hips began to move. Her eyes locked with his as she lowered herself down onto it, the large dildo stretching her wide as she went. Tessa moaned as she settled onto it, her pussy gripping it tight. She took a moment to adjust before she began to rock, her eyes never breaking contact with his as she moved. There was something predatory in his gaze as he watched her. He took pleasure in the power that he had over her. There wasn't another man alive that could make her debase herself like this. Only him. And the thought made tendrils of pleasure course through her as she shimmied up and down on the dildo for him. Her nipple stood out hard from her breasts -- a testament to how turned on she was right now.

Quinn watched her soundlessly as she worked the dildo, his eyes moving up and down in time with her hips. After an eternity he pushed himself out of the water and her head jumped to follow him as he moved behind her.

"Don't stop." He warned her. Tessa did as told. She could hear him rummaging around on the table but she could not see what he was doing. A moment later she felt the heat of his body behind her. His hand moved in front of her and attached something to her collar with a click and Tessa now found that he held a chained leash tightly in his hand. He gave her not a moment to adjust before rough hands took her by her shoulders and bent her forward so that her shoulders touched the ground and the front of her thighs were pressed up into her stomach. He was pressing her down so the dildo was still embedded in her pussy even as he exposed her ass to him. Tessa groaned as she felt him squirt lube into her asshole before his fingers slipped inside of her.

"I'd love to see two dicks in you at the same time but I'm not going to share you so this will have to do." Quinn growled above her as he worked to loosen her asshole. He was not being gentle, not that Tessa minded. Another finger joined the first, then a third. All stretching and pulling her loose. Behind them was his video camera and she knew that it was probably aimed straight for the money shot. He was going to want a close up of both dicks inside of her -- one real, one silicone. He had done something similar at the Playland Bar, but then it had been reversed with a small cock attachment in her ass while he fucked her pussy. But now a very large, very realistic dildo was buried inside of her as he began to slowly ease himself into her ass. Tessa stiffened and moaned and the overwhelming full feeling that overcame her.

"Do you like that?" He asked. Tessa was incapable of an answer but Quinn didn't seem to like her silence. He gave the leash a firm tug and pulled her neck backward. "Do you like that, bitch?!"

"Yes!" She moaned passed the pressure in her throat and the overwhelming fullness that forced the breath from her lugs.

"Do you wish you had another man double teaming you right now?" He asked. Tessa sensed anger in the question.

"No Master, only you." She moaned as she tried to wiggle her ass against him. He had not started moving yet and was standing stock still with his cock buried in her ass as he spoke. "Please ... please fuck me now."

"Good whore." Quinn said before he drew his hips backward, drawing his cock out of her ass almost to the tip before he snapped violently forward. He buried himself inside of her, his massive weight pressing her down onto the dildo in her pussy. Tessa tried to steel herself against the sensations pounding through her but they enveloped her in a white hot haze. She was still raw from the last orgasm but she was determined to let him ride her for as long as possible. She loved what she was feeling right now. She was helpless, bent double, cuffed and chained with a dildo in her pussy and a dick in her ass ... and she was loving every minute of it. She could not move a muscle and could only lay still and take it as he pounded into her but ... oh my god ... it felt so good!

Tessa stated to gasp in time with each of his thrusts, her hands working spasmodically where they were cuffed behind her. He laughed at her reaction, knowing that he had brought her body to complete ruin once again.

"Dirty slut..." He groaned as he pounded her. "Filthy whore..."

Like that he berated her, calling her every name that he could think of. The horrible words poured forth from his mouth and rained down in her like hail -- her body taking each of the stings and absorbing them, making them hers.

Tessa was crying out like a wonton animal now, taking his dick and the dildo and begging for more. And when she came it was with sound that she didn't even recognize. Still he plowed her from behind, his own orgasm trailing her's. But finally he arrived, his massive cock impaling her down onto the dildo as he shot warm strings of cum into her tight ass. Tessa merely laid beneath him, bent double and spent. Her body shivered and shook, his breath rattling in and out of her in great heaving gasps. Four months with him and his dick could still shake her down to her very core.

He gave the leash a hard yank as he pulled out of her and Tessa was forced off of the dildo at the same time. Suddenly she felt so empty.

"I think I'm going to leave this on you until it's time for you to go. I like how you look with a chain around your neck." He informed her as he tightened the leash and pulled her toward him. The next thing she knew, his mouth was on hers, his tongue probing deeply. Her hands were still bound behind her and her legs felt rubbery but his muscular arms were tight around her and held her firmly to him. He moved away from her mouth and down her neck, sucking and biting and claiming her for his own. She had no idea why but she loved it when he marked up her skin. Every time she saw it when she was home she would think of him and it would send fire racing through her.

"Are you going to miss this when you go home?" He asked her as he bit along her neck as if sensing her thoughts.

"Yes." She admitted with a gasp at one particularly hard nip.

"What are you going to miss?" He demanded.

"Your cock inside me, making me cum." She replied.

"And you didn't even want to stay when you first got here." He chuckled as he cupped her ass and gave it a firm squeeze.

"I don't want to wait another month for you to fuck me again." Tessa hated herself for saying it, but it was the truth. He was her drug and she had become addicted after her first taste of him. She hated him and needed him at the same time, just like any addict.

"Then we won't wait." Quinn rumbled between kisses. "You will be at the Playland at 2 pm on the 14th. I want you wearing your butt plug and the sluttiest clothes that you own. Understood?"

"Yes Master." She whispered.

"You were very popular so I'm going to tell them we're coming so they can put the word out." He informed her. "I'm going to fuck you in front of everyone. Would you like that?"

"Yes." Her voice trembled as she admitted it.

"I already have a special surprise in mind." He chuckled. Tessa tingled in anticipation at his words. There was a part of her that was slightly worried but at the same time, incredibly turned on. Whatever he wanted to do, there would be no fighting it. So it was probably best to try to relax and enjoy it. That was becoming her motto whenever he was around.

"Hello whore."

Tessa sighed as she swiveled on her bar stool to find Quinn behind her. She had arrived at the Playland fifteen minutes early to get herself a drink and work up her nerves for what was to come. She had just finished her drink and was contemplating ordering another when he had arrived.

"Pregaming?" He asked as he nodded at her drink. "Have a shot."

"I'm fine." She tried to protest but he was motioning for the bartender who quickly poured a double.

"I like you fucked up." Quinn informed her as he grabbed her roughly by the nape of her neck and tilted her face up before he poured the shot into her mouth. Tessa coughed but swallowed with a grimace. Straight vodka. She had always hated the taste of hard liquor.

"Ready for a good time, princess?" He asked as he stepped into her. One of his knees found it's way between her thighs and forced them apart. Tessa gasped slightly as she tried to cover herself with her hand. She was wearing a very short skirt with no underwear underneath and he was exposing her to the whole bar.

"Relax, they all like to watch. Or did you forget why we are here?" He asked as his hand slipped up under her tight leather skirt. He shoved two fingers inside of her and Tessa stiffened as he began to finger fuck her at the bar. "They're all watching you already princess."

Tessa's eyes slid around the room, finding that indeed, most of the attention was focused on she and Quinn -- all save for a man who was receiving a blow job of his own from a blond woman in one of the far booths.

Tessa knew that they had come here to fuck in front of an audience, but it was one thing to do it while locked in a room behind a dark pane of glass where she could not see the people watching her. But out here in the open in the bar was quite another.

Tessa stiffened and tried to pull away again but Quinn merely leaned into her and captured her lips with a growl as his free hand slid under the halter of her top and began to knead roughly at her breasts while he continued to fuck her with his fingers.

"Alright you two, you're getting everyone worked up." The bartender warned from behind them. "I ain't cleaning up cum from everyone jerking off in here. Take it to your room."

"Fine, one more for the road." Quinn requested.

"No..." Tessa tried to protest but another yank on her hair was all it took for force her mouth open to take the shot the bartender poured. She watched as the man slipped a white key card to Quinn before he roughly yanked her up and off the barstool. He pressed himself into her back as they walked, his hands sliding over her body and his mouth kissing and nipping its way down her neck.

"I called ahead and had them set up everything just right for us." He informed her as he bit at her earlobe. All the while he continued to nudge her toward the nondescript looking door that led to the viewing rooms. "Scared?"

"Yes." She admitted passed the hammering of her heart in her chest.

"Good." He chuckled as they reached the door. Tessa couldn't have turned back now even if she wanted to. He was already pushing her through, and she found herself in the familiar dark hallway on the other side. Moans and cries of pleasure greeted her from the speakers as her eyes jumped around to the various scenes playing out around her...

A woman riding a man revers cowgirl while he played with her ass. People in a sex swing. Two men doggy style. A woman jerking off two men at the same time...

Any type of depraved act that she could think of had probably been committed in these rooms while others watched. But she noticed that many of the eyes of the watchers were already sliding over to she and Quinn. Some stayed where they were tand continued enjoying their particular brand of debauchery but others were moving to follow as Quinn pushed her body through the halls.

"I paid for the big room." Quinn informed her as he maneuvered her to the one at the very end of the hall. The viewing window was twice the size of the others and Tessa knew that was the reason why he had chosen it. He wanted as many people watching them as possible.

Tessa felt herself begin to shiver and shake as he guided her over to the door. One quick pass over the keypad and it swung open and he ushered her inside. It was set up much the same as their last room with a large bed and a wall of sex toys while chains hung from various spots around the room. But the one noticeable difference was a padded chair that had been set up in front of the dark view window. It looked like a bench meant to hold down a body in a doggy style position with padded supports and straps for where arms and legs would go. It was positioned higher off the ground than a normal bench and was probably at the perfect height for his cock to reach her. And it was angled in such a way that they would have a perfect view from the window of him fucking her.

"Take off your clothes." Quinn demanded as he pushed her away from him into the center of the room. Now that she was here she was overwhelmed and unsure but he was in no mood for her hesitation. "Now!"

Tessa jumped slightly but reached up for her halter top.

"Face the window so they can see you."

She turned slightly so that she was facing the audience as she began to slowly pull her top open. As per his demands, she wore no bra underneath and her breasts tumbled free. It was cool in the room and her nipples automatically grew hard from the chill ... or perhaps it was arousal. She wasn't really sure at this point. Next she unzipped her thigh high boots and peeled them off of her legs before wiggling out of her leather skirt.

Once she was naked, he moved up beside her and pulled something out of the backpack she hadn't even realized that he had been carrying. It was her cuffs and collar, and his deft fingers were quick to secure them around her. Last he snapped a chain to the collar and let it fall down to run between her breasts and rest on her stomach.

"Turn around and bend over. Show them that pretty ass."

Tessa turned and did as he said, slowly bending at the waist and pressing her hands lightly on her thighs. She kept her back arched to at least try to look as enticing as possible. Quinn reached out to run one large hand over her ass before he gave her a sharp slap. Tessa stiffened with a little cry as she felt warmth spread between her legs. He alternated between slaps and rubs, every once in a while tapping the plug that she wore in her butt.

"You're all wet." His voice was low and husky as his hands glided over her ass before dipping down to slid into her pussy. "You really love the pain, don't you?"

"Yes." She moaned as he wiggled his fingers inside of her.

"Good." Was all he said as he withdrew his fingers before balling his hand in her hair and yanking her back upright. He guided her forward once again, leading her over to the wall of toys. Once there he stopped in front of a table and Tessa ran her eyes over what she found. A paddle, a crop, a leather strap with a handle at the end, a cane, a Scottish Tawse and three different floggers in various levels of extremity were all displayed there.

"Pick one." Quinn instructed. Tessa felt her breath catch in her throat. He meant to spank her in front of everyone, but he was going to let her choose the instrument of her own punishment. Tessa's eyes were huge as she turned them up to him in fear. "You have thirty seconds to pick one. After that I'll pick for you. I doubt that you'll like my choice."

Tessa's eyes snapped back down to the table and ran her eyes over the items once again. The paddle and the Tawse were probably safe choices. The cane and the crop were not. The floggers ranged from safe all the way up to terrifying. That left the strap that she was unsure of. She wanted to go for one of the safe ones that she knew that she would be able handle but something daring grabbed her at the last second and her hand darted out to the strap.

"Interesting choice." He murmured as she handed it to him. Tessa shivered as he ran it gently up her stomach and over her breasts before he turned and guided her back toward the window and the waiting audience.

"Lay down." He instructed as he pointed at the bench. Tessa quivered deep in her gut but slowly did as he said. She laid down on her stomach with her legs and arms on the supports and turned her face toward the back of the room. She stiffened as he plucked the plug from her ass and set it lightly aside before he got to work. His strong hands went about securing her legs before he ran straps tightly around her torso then tied down her arms. Last he repositioned her face so it was facing the window. "Don't turn away. They want watch you."

And with that, he moved back down her body, trailing the leather strap gently along her skin as he went. Once he was behind her he began to gently flick the strap along her thighs and ass, rubbing gently behind the sting. Tessa tightened her hands around the base of her restraints as she let out a soft sound from the back of her throat. This wasn't so bad.

"You like that, don't you?" Quinn asked as he strengthen his swings. Tessa jumped as they began to sting across her tender flesh, leaving burning trails in the wake. "How about now?"

A moan was her only reply. Her skin was tingling with every lash, her body jumping as much as the restraints would allow. Tessa began to moan along with each of the blows, Quinn increasing both the speed and the pressure. Soon they were stinging relentlessly across her skin. She knew that her ass was now a pretty red. His free hand continued to run over her, trailing the whip and massaging and caressing the damage that he did.

Tessa lost count of the blows but by the time his hand fell still, her ass was throbbing pleasantly. She relaxed into the restraints with a sigh, all of the tension leaving her body.

"Don't get too comfy, princess." He chuckled from behind her. Tess wished that she could see what he was doing but he kept himself out of her line of sight. She could tell that he had retrieved something from the wall of toys but he was being careful not to let her see it. A moment later she heard him return to the spot by her feet and she was finally able to crane her head to look at him and was horrified by what she found. He was setting up a sex machine like he had used on her at his house, the dildo attached to this one large and lifelike.

"Please ... not again." She moaned as she looked at it.

"You don't have a choice." He shrugged as he lined it up with her pussy. "Now shut up before I gag you."

Tessa grit her teeth and shut her eyes only to snap them back open a moment later when she felt him squeeze lube onto her. His thick fingers worked it into her, rubbing a probing more than was probably necessary. Tessa felt it as the lube began to warm up as he worked it into her tender skin. After a few more moments his hands fell away and she felt the press of silicone against her entrance. With a flick of his wrist he turned the machine on and Tessa stiffened with a moan as he guided it into her.

It started off slow but all it took was a few flicks of his wrist to send it thrusting rapidly into her. Every time it hit her it would jolt her body forward against her restraints. Tessa squeezed her eyes shut and let out a shuddering moan at the feel of it fucking her.

"Good slut." Quinn said as he gave her bottom a pat and stepped away from her. He was moving around her body, coming to rest by her head. He brushed her wild hair away from her face before he took her face in his strong hands and guided her to look forward. She found his cock in front of her eyes, hard and throbbing with a mushroom of precum already on the tip.

"Suck it." He rumbled as he moved his hips forward. Tessa compliantly opened her lips and accepted him into her mouth. She could not move in this position so all she could do was suck as he began to slide his dick in and out of her mouth. Tessa groaned as she was jolted from both ends.

Quinn found an alternating rhythm with the machine so that each one pushed her into the other as they thrust. Tessa's eyes rolled back as she loosened her throat and allowed him in as far as he could go, Quinn groaning with approval as she deep throated him.

There was something uniquely humiliating about this -- being completely strapped down with her red ass sticking in the air, being used at both ends while dozens of strangers watched her degradation. And it was still turning her on. Heat was rushing to her pussy ... but maybe the heated lube was helping that process along.

Tessa was moaning with every thrust of the machine now and she knew that it was sending vibrations along his cock deep in her throat. Her cries began to grow high and shrill even with her mouth occupied as her orgasm overcame her but he did not bother to pull out as she came. He merely groaned as he gained speed and began to jackhammer in and out of her mouth. His hands were tight on her face and she felt his fingers convulse as he came deep in her throat. He shouted as he shot his warm, salty cum down her throat before his entire body sagged. His dick slipped from her mouth and Tessa let her head drop down to the bench below her as she gasped for air. His hands rested on the bench on either side of her face as he leaned above her and attempted to get his shuddering body under control.

"Holy shit ... you're so good at sucking cock." He groaned from above her.

Tessa took some satisfaction in his words, even if she didn't let it show on her face. The machine was still thrusting inside of her and it was hard to concentrate on anything else at the moment. He let her sit with it for another minute before he moved behind her and shut it off. It left her body with a wet sound and she was finally able to relax.

Tessa felt his hands moving over her ass again and her throbbing skin responded to his touch. If she could have pressed her hips into him she would have. But he seemed to know what he was doing to her and laughed at her reaction. After a moment she felt his hands begin to free her from the restraints. Once they were all unlocked she slowly pushed herself up and sat on the bench facing the window.

"Come here." Quinn directed her toward a clear area by the feet of the chair. Her legs felt like rubber as she pushed herself up but she was still able to make her way over to him. She stood where he directed her and waited as he moved back over to the toys. When he returned he slid up behind her and secured a blindfold over her eyes and pulled her hands behind her and locked them into place before he pulled her tightly back to his chest. His hands cupped her breasts and played with her nipples as he began to kiss his way down her neck.

"Do you remember how I told you that I have a special surprise for you?" He asked as he played with her.

"Yes." She nodded as she relaxed back into him. For some reason, she liked the blindfold. It helped her to forget where she was and that there were people watching her.

"Are you ready for it?" He asked.

"No." Came her honest reply. Because whatever it was, it was designed to push her limits and she didn't always enjoy it while it was happening.

"Fair enough. But you don't really have a choice. Don't move a muscle."

With that he pulled away from her and Tessa found worry gripping her as he left her standing alone in the center of the room. She listened as he moved away from her but she was confused. It sounded like he was moving in the opposite direction of the wall of toys. A moment later her keen ears heard the sound of the door opening. Tessa stiffened and would have ripped her blindfold away if she could have but her bound hands prevented it.

"You better settle down before I use that braided flogger on your ass." His sharp voice warned her from across the room. Tessa grimaced but stopped moving. Still she was on high alert and let out a small sound of protest as she heard footsteps enter the room.

"Thanks for joining us." Quinn rumbled to the newcomer.

"Thanks for inviting me. And thanks for the show." Tessa stiffened at the newcomer's voice. It was a woman. "I see that we got your slave's attention."

"I told you I'd love to see you get fucked by another woman." Quinn informed Tessa as he moved behind her and placed his large hands on her shoulders. "Meet Mistress M. I've told her a lot about you."

Tessa felt the heat of another body in front of her before a soft hand ran over her body. Tessa felt the scrape of finely manicured nails against her skin as the woman before her tested the weight of her breasts in her hands before trailing down her stomach to play with her pussy. Tessa stiffened as she felt two slender fingers slip up inside of her.

"Very nice." That melodic voice purred as she pulled her fingers away. Tessa stiffened as she felt a leather crop slip under her chin and force her face up so the woman could examine her. "Most people in your position address me as Mistress, but since you already have a master and don't belong to me, you may call me Ma'am. Understood?"

"Yes Ma'am." Tessa replied, her voice thick. She wished that she could see the woman. Suddenly the blindfold that she had taken comfort in mere moments ago was now nothing but a hinderance.

"I've been told that you've never been with a woman before." M said as she touched her breasts again, her fingers rubbing warm circles around her nipples. "Are you interested in women?"

"I don't know." Tessa replied honestly. She had never really thought about it. She wasn't opposed to kissing another women but she wasn't sure how she felt beyond that.

"Well, you're going to find out today." M chuckled before she gave her nipple a hard pinch. Tessa stiffened and Quinn tightened his hands, holding her in place. "I'm told you like pain. Is that true?"

"Yes Ma'am." Tessa whispered with discomfort.

"I watched what your Master just did to your pretty little ass, and the way you moaned like a slut as he spanked you." M observed. "It was hot, and now I have some tension to work off. Tie her down."

The last was said to Quinn. In response his hands pulled her backward toward the bed. Tess stumbled along and gasped as he shoved her down face first over the edge of it. Yet he didn't seem like he was about to fuck her. Instead he gathered up her hands and unlocked the cuffs before easing his weight off of her. He then pushed her up onto the bed and forced her onto her back. She felt a chain attached to the cuff at her left wrist even as M did the same on the other side. She was surprised when they left her feet free but her hands had very little give and kept her stretched securely across the bed. A moment later she felt the bed dip as a body climbed in beside her. It was much too light to be Quinn. M crawled across the mattress and did not stop until she was straddling her. Tessa tossed her head and tried to figure out where Quinn had gone but he was silent. Watching.

A moment later Tessa felt the warm press of lips against hers. She stiffened at first but M merely pulled back and landed a firm swat to her nipple with her crop.

"Kiss me." The woman demanded sternly. Tessa moaned but complied. When she leaned back down Tessa returned the kiss, the woman starting off soft but soon turning long and deep. Her tongue slipped into her mouth and Tessa tangled her own with it. She felt hands on her body now, the skin soft but the touch firm. M was touching her everywhere but seemed to enjoy playing with her breasts the most. Tessa tried to relax and go with it. It wasn't very different than kissing a man. At least she was able to tell herself that until M lowered her body down and their breasts pressed together and their legs twined. She felt the woman's wet pussy against her thigh, so unlike the feel of a dick poking into her sise and waiting for her to open her legs. Once again there were slim fingers spreading her wide before slipping inside, M hissing at what she found.

"She's so wet." M murmured to Quinn. "You weren't joking."

"She's always ready to get fucked." Quinn returned, his voice husky from what he was watching. "Her pussy is like magic."

"A magic pussy." M laughed as she turned her attention back to Tessa. "I like that."

And with that, the woman was kissing her once again. Tessa moaned and opened her mouth to her. There was no fighting this situation. She might as well try to enjoy it. Tessa tumbled end over end as she made out with a woman for the first time in her life. Her skin was soft and supple against her, silky hair tumbling down to tickle Tessa's cheeks as they kissed. Her breasts were large and firm and Tessa felt her hard nipples pressing against her own. And her pussy was hot against her skin, almost as warm and wet as Tessa's own. Tessa had to wonder if Quinn was enjoying the show.

M began to stroke her again, her practiced fingers working magic inside of her as she rubbed at her clit. Despite the newness of the situation, Tessa couldn't help but respond. Her hips pressed greedily up into the woman's fingers as she began to mewl like a kitten beneath her. Just when she felt herself on the edge of climax the woman pulled her fingers away and Tessa whined in protest.

"I think she's ready. Give it to me." There was movement above her before Tessa felt something pressing into her pussy. The sensation was familiar and she was quick to realize it was a dildo.

"This one's a double." M purred in her ear. "We're going to ride it together."

Tessa sighed as she felt it slowly being slid inside her body. It was large, but not as large as Quinn, so she was easily able to accept its length. And once it was inside she felt it as M angled herself over her and took the other end of the dildo. Tessa felt the pressure of her body push it down into her and she moaned as the woman began to rock. She was already primed and she knew that it would not be long before she came. M's rhythm started out slow at first but quickly gained in speed, her large breasts slapping against her own with every thrust. Tessa wished that she could see what was going on above her but she could not and just let go and concentrated on her own body. M was making small sounds of pleasure above her and soon their combined cries rose up to fill the air. When she came Tessa threw her head back with a shrill cry, her entire body going rigid as she thrust her breasts out against M. The woman continued to writhe above her, not content until she reached her own climax. She stayed locked above her for one endless moment once she did before she rolled off of Tessa with a contented moan, pulling the dildo out of her as she went. The moment she was out of the way, Tessa felt the weight of Quinn's large frame as he sat down beside her. His hands were immediately at her breasts, his touch rough and needy.

"Jesus Christ, that was so fucking hot." He groaned as he leaned in and began to kiss and bite his way down her neck. "I'm going to explode if I don't stick my dick in her soon."

"We can't have that." M chuckled in amusement as she rolled upward and reached for Tessa's right hand. "Unhook her."

Quinn reached for the left and together they worked at her hands. Once she was free, M guided her to her knees as Quinn rolled onto his back and stretched out along the bed. They seemed to be moving without consulting each other. They must have discussed what they wanted to do to her before they had even arrived at the bar today.

"Ride your master." M instructed her as she guided Tessa toward Quinn. Tessa slung her leg over his waist and straddled him, Quinn's needy hands lifting her up to guide her onto his dick. He let out a satisfied groan as she surrounded him and gripped tight. Tessa lethargically began to shimmy, already exhausted from the previous two orgasms but Quinn was not having it.

"Faster!" He barked at her as he gave her ass a firm slap. She stiffened with a hiss as her already throbbing skin stung from the new abuse. Still she picked up the pace and started to snap her hips accordingly. His hands were at her breasts, squeezing and pulling while slapping her nipples. She heard noises from M behind them but Tessa was not paying attention. It's not like she could have looked behind her if even if she wanted to. But it was mere moments later before she felt the woman climb onto the bed behind her.

"Easy." The woman purred as Tessa felt her hands on her shoulders. She slowed down her rhythm and was forced to stop entirely as the woman bent her over and pressed her chest into Quinn. Tessa let out a wild moan a moment later when she felt the head of a dildo pressing into her ass. It was then that she realized the M was now wearing a strapon and that they were both going to fuck her. The strap was already slick with lube and M ran it between her cheeks for a moment before she began to ease into her. Tessa tried to breathe with it but it was so hard to maintain her composure with Quinn so large already inside of her. And once the strapon was filling her, M did not give her a moment to adjust. She merely began to thrust. Tessa was pressed into Quinn with every thrust and he began to jerk up to meet her. She tried to move her hips in time with them, bouncing between the two in rhythm -- forward to Quinn, backward to M. Quinn's hands were still on her tits while M's were on her waist while Tessa rested hers on Quinn's shoulders and tried to brace herself there.

They were a tangle of arms and legs and bodies. Every once in a while someone would slap her ass but she lost track who was hitting her. At one point, M gathered her hair up and began to pull her head backward as she pounded into her ass with the strapon.

Tessa felt like she was losing herself. Never before had she had so much pleasure focused solely on her. Every cell within her body tingled and shot fire down to the core of her. Her gasps were beginning to speed up and her third orgasm of the day rushed up to claim her. Tessa threw her head back with a scream but both M and Quinn were relentless. Neither of them were going to stop until Quinn followed her over the edge. He was grunting as he thrust up into her and her abused pussy felt every move that he made. She could tell that he was almost there and was relieved when he finally strained upward and emptied himself into her depths. M stopped her thrusting once he had gotten off and all three stayed locked together in a moment of ecstasy.

Finally M pulled the strapon out of her ass and Tessa collapsed down onto Quinn with a moan. She felt him chuckle beneath her before he gathered up her wrists and held her hands behind her back, effectively locking his body around her. His free hand was rubbing her ass almost affectionately, the rest of his body boneless beneath her.

"Thanks for inviting me to play." M's voice pulled her from her stupor. Tessa stiffened when she felt M run her riding crop down her back and over her ass before wiggling it against her pussy. "She screams real pretty. Call me any time."

"Thanks for the help." Quinn rumbled with another heavy clap on her ass. Tessa moaned at the treatment but did not try to pull away from him. She merely lay on him and tried to listen as M moved across the room. She heard the rustle of clothes and could only assumed that the woman was getting dressed once again. A moment later the door opened and closed and she was "alone" with Quinn once again.

"We still have some time princess." He murmured in her ear.

"No more please..." Tessa moaned as she dropped her head to his shoulder in exhaustion.

"You can take it. But if you need a little break..." He informed her as he sat up, drawing her body with him. Tessa moaned but he didn't care and merely guided her up and off of the bed. He kept the blindfold on and Tessa had no idea where he was leading her. But a moment later her was bending her over something padded once again. It felt like another bench but this time it was higher than the other and designed to keep her feet flat on the ground while supporting her upper body while it was bent double. The second she was in position she felt him lower something over her back and wrists and realized that she had just been put into stocks. Her feet he pressed into locks at the base of the restraint system so they were held wide open while still resting flat on the floor. He disappeared for a moment before she felt him reappear and press something into her ass. Tessa stiffened with a moan as he began to ease something inside of her -- a small ball like object that her body readily accepted. Once it was in he kept going, two more balls of increasing size following. Tessa realized that he had just inserted anal beads.

"Get comfy princess." Quinn chuckled before there was a click and the beads began to vibrate inside of her. Tessa moaned and tried to shift but, yet again, she was held firmly in place.

"Don't leave." Tessa bade, but he seemed determined to do the opposite of what she wanted.

"I won't be gone to long." He replied. "Maybe."

And with that the door opened and shut and silence filled the room. Tessa didn't have long to worry about it. The anal beads were still vibrating inside of her, low and soft but all-consuming none the less. Tessa tried to wiggle her butt and dislodge them but they were so firmly inside of her that she knew there would be no hope.

She wondered how she was positioned right now. Was she turned with her butt toward the window to give everyone in the hall a view of her wiggling ass? Or was she turned to the side so they could watch Quinn fuck her when he returned? It was probably the latter.

Once again Tessa lost all concept of time as she stood there with the beads buzzing away in her ass as she wiggled and squirmed in the stocks. She wasn't coming but she had a feeling that Quinn wanted it that way. A slow burn to drive her crazy until he returned.

It felt like an eternity passed before the door opened and closed once again. He said not a word as he let the tension build. But she soon heard his heavy footsteps crossing the room. And when he reached her, his hard hands moved over her body, touching everywhere before they settled on her waist. The head of his cock pressed into her pussy and she would have thrust back into him if she could have. He merely held himself there, his cock drawing lazy circles around her pussy lips.

"Do you want this?" Quinn rumbled from behind her.

"Yes!" Tessa moaned as she once again tried to thrust backward but all she accomplished was digging the stocks into her neck and wrists.

"Beg for it."

"Please Master, I need your cock!" She wailed to the quiet room. "Please fill me up and fuck me hard! Please ... I want you!"

"Like this?" He asked as he began to slowly slide into her.

"Harder..." She begged at his maddening pace.

"Like this?" He asked again as he thrust hard and deep.

"Yes!" She cried out as she tried to stand up on her tiptoes and give herself more leverage.

"Who owns you?" He demanded as he picked up his pace.

"You do!" She cried over the wet slapping sounds of their skin meeting. His balls were hitting the back of her thighs as the beads continued to buzz inside of her.

"That's a good slut." He snarled as he slapped at her ass, jostling the beads inside of her. Tessa screamed as she began to unravel. "That's it ... come on my cock..."

So Tessa threw her head back and did just that. The orgasm gripped her violently and she gave herself over to it. Quinn continued to drill into her even once she collapsed down into the stocks with a moan. He merely gripped her hips with such force that she knew she would be finding fingers marks on her skin tomorrow. It didn't matter. Nor did the way that she rocked violently forward with each of his thrusts. Her breath was forced from her lungs in shuddering wheezes in time with his hips. And when he finally came he pulled her hips backward with all the force in his body and buried himself inside of her as far as he could go.

There they remained locked together, Tessa bent double and Quinn's back as straight as a steel rod with his dick locked inside of her. He savored the moment before he pulled out of her, his cum dribbling down her leg and onto the floor. He took his time pulling the beads out of her and Tessa stiffened and cried out with each layer that was removed. Finally they were free and he tossed them aside before freeing her from the stocks. He made no attempt to catch her when her legs lost all support and she slumped down to the floor at his feet. Quinn only let her rest there a moment before there was a tug from the chain on her collar and he pulled her up onto her knees.

"Clean me up." He demanded.

Compliantly she opened her mouth and accepted his cock. Small sighs escaped her as she began to lick and suck along his length, lapping up his cum and her own sweet juices. Halfway through he yanked the blindfold off of her eyes and Tessa blinked up at him. She found him staring down at her, his eyes focused on her mouth as she cleaned him. Finally it was done to his satisfaction and he pushed her away from him. Tessa landed on the floor at his feet and curled up in a little ball. She just wanted to sleep now. Quinn chuckled as he nudged her onto her back and hunkered down beside her to examine her.

"What's wrong? Did I fuck you to death?"

"Almost." She breathed as she blinked up at him.

"Good." He grinned as he gave her nipple a tweak before pushing himself up. She watched him pull on his pants before gathering up her clothes and tossing them down beside her. "Get dressed nice and slow. Give them a show."

Tessa sighed as she sat up and slowly began to pull on her boots. Once the first one was on she extended her leg and ever so slowly pulled up the zipper. The second one was slow to follow. Gracefully she stood and planted her feet firmly with her back to the window before she slowly bent over to retrieve her skirt. She slipped her legs through the supple leather and pulled it up around her body before bending to grab her halter. She knew that bending over flashed the window once again and she hoped that those watching appreciated her commitment to the show. Once she was dressed, Quinn moved over to her and slowly began to uncuff her.

"Pleased?" She asked him, her body standing so close to his that they were almost touching.

"Very." He assured her. "You seemed to enjoy yourself. Thinking of switching to the other side?"

"No, I only want your cock." She informed him with an ironic smile. God damn it, but it was true. And Tessa hated herself for that. "But if you want to invite her to play occasionally, I won't complain."

"Good answer." He rumbled as he also freed her from the collar and shoved them all into his bag, along with her butt plug. Had she done so good that he was giving her a break from it as a reward? Tessa would take it. "Let's get out of here before I have to fuck you again."

"Would that be so bad?" Tessa smirked.

"Don't tempt me." He snorted as he pulled the door open for her and gestured for her to leave. Tessa slipped outside and found the hallway packed. She gasped in surprise and felt it as Quinn drew closer to her in the press of bodies. Vaguely she wondered if Mistress M was still in the crowd somewhere watching her.

Once again people were touching her but this time she had been expecting it so it didn't startle her like it had last time. Most were behaving respectfully but she caught a few of them leering at her and their gazes made her slightly uncomfortable. Thankfully Quinn was quick to guide her out to the bar before anyone got too handsy. Once again, he led her over to the bar and directed her to sit down on a barstool. He motioned at the bartender and murmured something to the man who was quick to scurry away for his order. When he returned he set two shot glasses full of clear liquid down in front of her.

"I'm gonna go take a piss." Quinn informed her. "Those better be gone when I get back."

Tessa grimaced but did not argue as he slipped away.

"Can I at least get a chaser?" She asked the bartender. "Put it on his tab."

"Sure thing." The man grinned in amusement at her tone as he poured her a soda and sild it toward her. He then ambled off to the other end of the bar to help other customers. Tessa decided to bite the bullet and just get it over with. Quickly she downed the first shot and chased it with the soda before following it with the second shot. Tessa almost gagged on the second one but managed to keep it down. Once she was done she rested her head in her hands on the bar and let the liquor take hold.

She wondered why he was always trying to get her drunk when they came here? He didn't do that anywhere else, even when they had spent the weekend together at his house.

Tessa was pulled from her thoughts by the feel of a hand in the small of her back and she looked up, expecting to find Quinn behind her. Instead a stranger stood there, a cocky grin on his face as he stared down at her with far too much familiarity.

"Hi gorgeous." He smiled down at her.

"Not interested." Tessa muttered as she took another sip of the soda in front of her.

"Come on, I'm just being friendly." He returned. "I caught your show. You're amazing."

Instantly Tessa was uncomfortable. She had no idea what the rules were in this place but she had a feeling that unsolicited conversations with people leaving the performance rooms was probably frowned upon.

"You're making me uncomfortable." Tessa said as she tried to scoot away from him but he merely took another step toward her and boxed her into the bar.

"I find that hard to believe. Nothing seems to make you uncomfortable. We should hook up. We could have a lot of fun together."

"No." Tessa was firm this time as her annoyance began to get the best of her.

"Come on, I saw what a dirty slut you are. You like getting dick and I like pussy. Perfect match. I can pay you, if that's what you're worried about."

"I said no!" Tessa snapped as she shot off her seat and rounded on him. He was standing so close that he had her backed into the bar but she was not afraid of him, just angry.

"Listen you little bitch..." The man snapped as he reached out to grab her wrist but that was as far as he got. The next thing Tessa knew, he had been yanked violently backward. He landed hard on the ground at the feet of an enraged Quinn.

"You don't touch her." Quinn's voice was low and dangerous before he reached down and hauled the man up by his shirt. One punch was all it took to lay him out across the floor in a spray of blood with a broken nose. Tessa watched in shock as Quinn moved to stand before her, his hulking body cutting her off from the bar that was suddenly alive with activity around her. Bouncers had appeared and descended on the man on the ground even as the bartender materialized behind her once again. Tessa peeked out from behind Quinn and was in time to see the bouncers shoving the stranger toward the front door.

"I'm so sorry about that Mr. Parker. Your drinks are on the house. That type of behavior is not tolerated here." The bartender was appologizing in a rush.

Quinn waited until the man had been shoved from the building before he turned back around to face the bar. Tessa looked up at him in worry but he was currently refusing to meet her gaze. Instead it was the bartender that addressed her.

"Are you ok Miss?"

"I'm fine." Tessa replied as she rubbed at her sore wrist where the man had grabbed her. It wasn't too bad. Quinn tended to leave her with deeper bruises than she would probably come away from this experience with. But this was <em>different</em>. She liked it when Quinn roughed her up. But that man ... it had been entirely unwelcome.

"Again, I apologize. The safety of our participants is of the utmost importance.

Especially the women. I hope this won't keep you away. He won't be allowed back in here."

"It's fine." Tessa replied as she crossed her arms over her chest and leaned up against the bar. The shots were starting to make everything a little spinny. Damn it, the timing was horrible.

She was distracted a moment later when the same wiry man as last time appeared from the office and handed Quinn a thumb drive. He merely pocketed it before jerking his head toward the door without a word to anyone. Tessa sighed as she followed him. A bad feeling was beginning to take up residence in the pit of her stomach. Did he think that she had done something to encourage the man's behavior?

"Maybe I should take a taxi this time." Tessa said as she gestured helplessly toward the street.

"No." Was all he said as he took her firmly by the shoulder and directed her toward the parking lot.

"But I want to..."

"I don't care." His gruff voice returned as he herded her toward his SUV. The moment they reached it he unlocked it and all but shoved her inside. Tessa was half temped to jump back out while he was rounding the car to his side but something kept her in her seat. Instead she watched miserably as he climbed into the vehicle and slammed the door behind him.

"Why are you so angry?" She asked in worry as he guided the car out of the parking lot. No answer. "I didn't do anything to encourage him if that's what you're thinking."

More silence. His eyes were focused out on the road ahead of him and he was moving the car with jerky motions that were doing nothing to help her swimming head.

"Will you just say something?!" She finally snapped at him. "I didn't do anything wrong!"

"I know that! God damn it!" He roared back as he jerked the car hard to the right and pulled off into a supermarket parking lot. He parked away from the store under the shade of some trees, far away from the other cars in the lot. "I heard what that fucker said to you and I heard you tell him no, <em>repeatedly</em>."

"So what's your problem?" She shot back at him.

"He fucking touched you." Quinn growled as those blazing blue eyes locked on her.

"Ok ... well... that's a shitty thing for him to do but it's not a crime..."

"He fucking touched you." Quinn repeated, his voice shaking with rage. Tessa was speechless at the intensity in his eyes. "You're <em>mine</em>, and he touched you."

Tessa's mouth snapped shut at his words. Whatever she had been expecting, it had not been this. She stared at him, her eyes transfixed as he began to slide across the seat toward her. Tessa found that she was suddenly incapable of producing sound. Instead her eyes were locked on his, tracking him as he drew ever closer. And the moment he was before her, he pressed her back into the window, his face looming large before her.

"You, Tessa Daniels, belong to me. Do you understand what I mean?"

Tessa's heart was thundering inside of her as the breath rattled in and out of her suddenly weak body.

"Yes." She finally managed to squeak out.

"Do you?" He rumbled.

"Yes." She finally repeated after a long pause, her voice a little stronger this time.

"So, I'm going to give you one more chance to make a choice." Quinn informed her as his hand reached up to cup her face. He was being none too gentle even though the contact was intimate. "One last chance to back out now. Say the word and I'll take you home and this all ends. No more dinner parties, no more texting, no more anything. But if you continue, we're both all in. We'll belong with each other, even if your body belongs to me. That'll never change. So what do you want?"

Tessa stared at him, her eyes unblinking. She felt every cell in her body vibrating in time within her. She knew what he was asking her in that round about way. This would never be a typical "relationship" but if she chose to stay, they would be together, however they chose to define that.

"You." She finally whispered, her eyes large. The word hung between them, the air in the car heavy. "I want you."

Quinn didn't blink, didn't falter. His eyes continued to drill into her, his clenched jaw hard. Finally he offered her a hard nod before he yanked her forward off the door.

"Get your ass in the back seat."

Tessa complied and scrambled into the back as quickly as her short skirt would allow. She felt him give her a shove when she was halfway there and she tumbled face first onto the back seat. He was on her in an instant, his large body pressing her down into the leather. His hands were automatically at her waist, pushing her skirt upward as he used his knees to spread her legs. One of her feet was wedged in between the seat and his leg as the other was knocked down to the floorboard. He reached down between them and the moment that he was free of his pants he slammed into her from behind. Tessa cried out as she pressed her face into the warm leather and dug her nails into the seat. He was being rough and needy but not in the angry and dominant way that she was used to. His actions almost seemed fueled by desperation. Anger was still there as well, but it was not directed at her. More at that unknown man in the bar that had dared to grab her. He was fucking her now as if he was claiming what belonged to him -- a mating ritual after a hard fought battle for dominance.

Tessa squeezed her eyes shut and gladly accepted the force of his thrusts. He was taking what was his and she was gladly allowing it. A certain measure of relief was filling her as well. She had been angry but there had been a small sliver of fear that had filled her when the man had grabbed her. But Quinn had rushed in and protected her when needed. So she let that relief wash through her as he fucked her.

The weight of his body was crushing her so thoroughly that there was nothing that she could do but lay there and take it. And part of her knew that was what he needed. Just like she needed to be claimed and used by him.

His hips slammed into her there in the quiet of his car, his powerful thrusts joling her forward with every hit. Tessa spread herself as wide as she could and let him take what he wanted. There was no turning back now. Every piece of her belonged to him.

Despite how many times he had already taken her today, he didn't seem to be tired or spent. Instead he seemed like he was trying to prove a point. His emotions were driving him on right now and pushing him passed the point of exhaustion where he no longer felt anything.

Tessa could feel him moving inside of her, his large cock hitting her g spot as he rammed in and out of her, the weight of his body pressing him even more firmly into her. She could barely breathe but still managed to let sharp little cries escape her with every thrust of his cock. Electricity was jolting through her, straight up from her very center and reaching every nerve in her body. Her cries were growing more shrill and rapid as he pushed her closer and closer to orgasm. Suddenly his hand balled through her hair and yanked her head violently backward. He bent her neck at an awkward angle so it rested on his shoulder and forced her to arch her back painfully. But Tessa loved every second of it.

"When you come, I want you to scream my name." He growled into her ear. Tessa felt a shudder of delight rip through her at his demand. With that he shoved her head back down and turned his attention back to the task at hand.

The slap of his skin against hers became more frantic, his hips slamming like pistons into her. It would have broken a normal woman in two, but Tessa was not a normal woman. Instead she dropped her head to the leather of the seat beneath her and rode out the pain as the pleasure within her began to grow. And when she came, it was like an explosion.

"Quinn!" She screamed into the heavy air, so loud that people outside would be able to hear if they were close enough. Fuck it, she didn't care anymore. All she cared about was being swept away in the tidal wave of her orgasm as she moaned and writhed beneath him. And the sound of her screaming her name drove him over the edge. He came with one last mighty thrust that rocked her so far forward that she had to brace herself with her hands to keep her head from hitting the door. Every muscle of his body was locked as he emptied himself inside of her as shuddering groans and gasps for air escaped his large form.

Finally he collapsed down on top of her and Tessa let out a wheeze as his massive weight crushed her to the leather seat. They laid there for an eternity, Tessa's heart rate slowly returning to normal as he tried to get his breathing under control. Soon they began to settle but he still refused to move. His dick was limp inside of her now but it was held in place by the weight of their bodies and he didn't seem to be in a hurry to remove it.

Tessa wasn't sure how long they laid there but it was he that finally broke the spell the car seemed to be under. She felt him shift above her, his dick finally slipping out of her. He was pushing himself up and pulled her with him, yanking her down into his lap with her chest pressed into his back as one muscular arm slid up around her throat and captured her in a tight headlock.

"Who do you belong to?" He rumbled in her ear.

"You." She replied without hesitation.

"All of you. Not just your pussy."

"Yes Master, I belong to you." Tessa affirmed passed the weight of his arm. She remembered what he had first said about only calling him by name when he gave her permission. Now that the moment was over, he would want her to return to calling him Master.

"Good girl." He purred as his free hand slipped under her top and began to massage her nipples. Again, she realized that there was nothing sexual about his touch right now. It was simply an absent gesture for him. A way to occupy his hands. "Do you still hate me?"

Tessa thought about the question before she answered carefully.

"I think a small part of me will always have to hate you if I want to keep letting you do this to me." She replied honestly. "But the part of me that needs you is far bigger. I try not to think about it. It feels a lot better to just go with it."

"Ditto." He chuckled as he gave her nipple a pinch before releasing her and shoving her toward the front seat. "Let's get the hell out of here."

Tessa carefully climbed into the front, Quinn following closely behind. It amazed her that he could squeeze his big body over the seat. But soon they were both buckled in and driving again. Tessa watched the world slip by in silence before she realized that they were heading away from her apartment.

"Wait ... this isn't the way to my place."

"I'm not taking you to your place." Quinn informed her matter-of-factly. "You're spending the rest of the weekend at my house."

It was a statement, not a question. He wasn't asking her permission or opinion on the matter. He was just telling her a fact. And Tessa could not argue. She didn't <em>want</em> to argue. Not when she wanted to be used by him over and over again. And she had a feeling that the weekend wasn't going to be long enough.

Tessa knelt on the rug in front of Quinn's big bed, her hands locked behind her and attached by a short chain that ran up to her collar. Her feet were forced wide by a spreader bar which exposed her pussy to him. He was walking around her in tight circles, his wrist flicking out every once in a while to land a stinging blow across her skin with a riding crop. Tessa stiffened and cried out each time, but she was not fooling him. Not when her cries were high and filled with pleasure, not pain.

It had been six months since that day at the bar where the man had grabbed her, and this had been every weekend of her life ever since. They still fucked in secret every time they got together with their friends for their monthly dinners. It was like a secret game they played between them. Yet it had become such a small part of her life now because every Friday night to Sunday evening, she belonged to him. They had even gone on a two week vacation together in the fall where they had rented a tiki hut over the ocean in the middle of no where and had fucked endlessly for fourteen days straight. And no matter how often her took her or in how many different ways, Tessa could not get enough of his cock.

"Do you like this?" He asked from above her as the crop flicked out and fell across one exposed nipple.

"Yes!" She gasped as the blow sent pleasure arcing through her like lightning.

"What do you want?" He asked her.

"I want you to bend me over and fuck me from behind." She replied without thought.

Despite all of the wild things that he did to her body, doggy style was always her favorite. Maybe because it opened her up wide to him and he could go deep and fill her to the very core.

"And what will I get in return if I do?" He asked her in amusement.

"Anything you want!" She panted the words passed the haze of her own need.

"Anything?" His voice sounded intrigued. "If I bend you over right now and fuck you like a dog, you'll give me anything that I want? No questions asked?"

"Yes, anything." Tessa was quick to nod. She didn't care what she was promising. He had fucked her in every way imaginable. Whatever he would want in return, she knew she was capable of handling it.

"Bend over." He commanded her. With a moan of anticipation, Tessa bent at the waist and lowered her face to the floor.

She felt more blows from the crop land across her ass before he sent a few light flicks at her pussy. Tessa moaned and wiggled her ass for him. A moment later she felt hands gliding over her skin. He rubbed her ass and thighs, grazing over her back and ghosting through her hair before grabbed her roughly by her waist and thrusting into her. Tessa pressed back into him with a wild cry, her hips pulsing to meet him so they crashed together every time that they connected. He would draw almost out of her and dive back in, thick and hard and uncaring. Tessa took it all and begged for more. He always loved listening to her beg for him to fuck her harder.

After an eternity of deep thrusts he bent over her, pressing his body tightly to hers as his hips began to jackhammer in and out of her. His body was like a rock above her, hard and unyielding. His cock equally so as it moved inside of her. His hands reached around her body and cupped her breasts, every part of her captive to his whims.

And when they came it was together, Tessa tightening around him with a scream and milking him dry as he shot his hot load into her. Once it was over she shivered and shook beneath him, her legs quivering from having to support the weight of his body. He seemed to savor the moment for a while before he pulled out of her. Yet he made no move to help her off the floor.

"I love how you look like that. It's always been my favorite. On your knees at my feet with your ass in the air. Helpless."

She could feel him hunker down beside her now, his eyes on her as he spoke. Suddenly his palm landed across her ass with a loud smack, the blow so hard that it rocked her forward slightly. Tessa cried out at the sharp sting of pain racing across her tender skin. Another blow landed, then another and Tessa knew that her skin probably bore the red imprint of his hand.

"You owe me something." He reminded her as he began to rub her ass, soothing the lingering sting of his hand away.

"Anything." Tessa promised.

"Good, because you're moving in with me."

"What?" Tessa gasped as her eyes flew open. She craned her neck and found him staring down at her, his face perfectly serious.

"You said you would do whatever I wanted, and this is what I want." He informed her. "You will have your own home office and I won't bother you when you're working. I understand you work long, hard hours. But the rest of the time outside of work, you belong to me. Every minute of every day, you're mine. Got it?"

"I..." Tessa mumbled, at a complete loss for words.

"The correct response is, 'Yes Master'." He informed her as he grabbed her by her shoulders and pulled her upward. She was still on her knees but now she was upright, one of his large hands slipping under her chin to tilt her face toward him so he could study her.

"Yes Master." Tessa whispered, her eyes wide as she stared at him.

She could barely believe that she spoke the words even as they slipped from her mouth. Tessa was shocked with herself. Despite her promise to give him whatever he wanted, he couldn't force her to move in with him. But something deep inside of her told her what the correct answer was. Vaguely she wondered what Kate and the others would think once they found out, but she couldn't bring herself to care.

"Good girl. I'll hire movers to pack up your shit." He informed her with a pat on her ass before her stood and brought his cock to her mouth. "You know what to do."

Indeed she did. Happily Tessa opened her mouth and sucked him as he slipped inside. This was where they both belonged.
