Nina was a trainee Accountant, straight out of university she had joined a branch of one of the countries most prestigious firms, but in one of the provincial cities. While wealthy and safe it was not the most exciting of places and with the job came a lot of work and constant study to pass her exams.

At 21 Nina was tall, slim and graceful, a natural athlete who enjoyed sports, including running and athletics, but loved above all others dancing. Salsa was her favourite.

Seeking some downtime from relentless study, Nina persuaded some of her colleagues to go to the club opposite their office on Friday evening. It was a salsa night and it was Nina's favourite activity. The girls went for a meal beforehand and had a few drinks, the arrived at the club early and had fun dancing and a few more drinks. Nina did not drink much generally and was sensible now, she was there for the dancing after all.

Pausing from a break Nina sat out the next dance and watched those on the dance floor, one man caught her attention, his fluid moves impressed her and she admired his technique. As he danced he caught Nina staring and made eye contact and made a note to seek her out later.

He caught up with her a few minutes later, she had come onto the dance floor and was looking for someone to partner with. Nina was a little surprised, but gladly took him up on his offer, after all he was a great dancer. He was also black and Nina was slightly wary of Black men. However, she soon forget her prejudiced as this man led her through the next dance.

After two dances they took a break, and chatted by the bar, she learnt his name was Des and he taught Salsa, and his friend ran this club night. They danced over and over again that night, Des teaching Nina new moves and the the dancing getting more and more intimate as the night progressed.

The club started closing at 11, and Des and Nina walked outside chatting. Nina felt exhilarated and excited. She had never considered dating a black man before but Des has been so exciting to dance with. They talked about Salsa, and the best clubs, Des took her number promising to send her Salsa nights to check out. He put his arms around her and pulled her closer to him, swaying gently and kissed her full on the lips, after a moments hesitation Nina started to kiss him back.

After a few minutes as the street grew quieter Des took Nina's hand an told her "Come on, I'll give you a ride home", her led her up the street to a car park, where his car was parked.

Nina became aware of a man following them and as she got into the back seat of the car, the man greeted Des before taking the car keys and slide into the drivers seat. Des introduced Wayne who would drive "coz I've had a couple". Wayne explained he had to pick some kit up from Des and would then drop Nina home. Nina was wary of this but did not want to spoil the mood or put off this handsome dancer.

They drove for 10 minutes to the less good side of town, Wayed parked up in front of a row of slightly scruffy semi-detached houses, Des got out as well and walked round to open the door for Nina, surprised Nina took his had as he pulled up into his arms and kissed her, sliding his hands into the small of her back. He took her hand again and followed Wayne into one of the houses.

Once inside, Wayne went upstairs and Des put on some soft Salsa music, he turned to Nina and swayed with the rhythm. Nina smiled and moved closer as they danced to together, Des's hands going over Nina's body. After a few minutes Wayne joined them in the living room, suddenly Des span Nina towards Wayne, who took her hands and danced with her. They stopped and showed Nina moves for salsa dancing as a trio, and soon Nina was dancing between the two men. It was relaxed and fun to dance with two strong men, who liked to dance as much as she did.

Des and Wayne expertly spun Nina between them, moving closed closer and closer. This increased the physical contact between their bodies and both men started to get erections.

The album switched to a slower song and Des put his arms around Nina and gently swayed her, Wayne pressed himself against Nina's back. Nina felt a jolt of alarm at this. She had enjoyed the dancing, but this was becoming too intimate.

Des started kissing her neck, as Wayne gently gripped her hips. Des pulled her closer and moved to kiss her on the lips, Wayne pressed himself against her, Nina was too caught up in the moment to feel his erection through his trousers.

Des's hands were in the small of Nina's back, he slowly edged his fingers under Nina's top and gently massaged her back. Des started kissing Nina's neck. Nina wriggled trying to push him away but Wayne gripped her harder and Des moved one hand to the back of Nina's head and held her. Wayne also slide one hand under her shirt and started to gentle caress Nina's midriff. Nina was alarmed, the mood had changed from relaxed fun to frightening, and her heart pounded, her body through knew what coming and she could feel her vagina getting lubricated.

Both sets of hands climbed higher and started lifting up her bra, Nina struggled but was no match for both men. Wayne reaching from behind undid the button on Nina's jeans and undid her zip, Nina pulled away from Des, "no, stop, I want to go home now" Nina pleaded, "Hush girl, why you go on so?" Des demanded, he silenced her with a firm kiss, which took her breath away. Wayne had his hand down the front of the jeans and started to finger Nina's vulva through her kickers, he could feel her getting wet.

Trying to escape this attention Nina sank down to her knees, Des reached down and took her right hand, and using his other hand pulled down his trouser and underpants, a long thick black penis, semi erect flopped out, just at eye line with Nina, Des forced Nina's hand onto it, curling her fingers around his shaft and making her stroke it. To her side Wayne also did the same, taking Nina's left hand. Nina tried to pull her hands away but both men held firm, Wayne reached forward with his free hand and grabbed the back of Nina's head, pushing her towards Des's fully erect penis.

Nina kept her lips closed when Des's penis touched them, she could feel the heat of cock throbbing against her face and she let out a gasp of surprise, and that was enough for Des to get the tip of his penis in. Wayne was using Nina's hand to stroke his shaft. Nina sobbed as Des forced more of his penis into her unwilling mouth, but despite the shock Nina was very aroused, her tipples were erect and her vagina lubricated.

Slowly she accepted Des's penis and stopped trying to struggle, tentatively she sucked on the penis and was rewarded with a taste of the pre-cum. Nina hesitantly started to stroke Des's shaft. Both men relaxed knowing they had broken and subjugated her.

Nina pulled her mouth away, "please will you let me go now" she pleaded again. "Sure girl, you just suck a little bit more and it will all be over", Des replied, "Sure girl, we just want a little bit more of your honey" Wayne added.

Wayne turned Nina's head towards him, Nina resisted at first but took his penis in her mouth. Both men had large hard penises. Nina knew she should feel revolted by this, but was in fact feeling so aroused she could barely think. She left trapped and helpless but that thought made her tingle.

Des had pulled up his trousers and signed to Wayne who pulled out and Des took Nina's arms and lifted her to her feet. Without a word Des took Nina's hand, and led her towards the stairs. Nina legs felt weak and shaky, she did not utter a word, scared she may break whatever spell it was that had bound her. Wayne followed her and had to support her as they climbed the stairs, her heart thumping she struggled to comprehend how quickly events had turned. Wayne, eyeing Nina's firm buttocks getting even harder at the thought of what they would do to her next.

At the top of the carpeted stairs, Des led her to the front bedroom, Des pushed open the door, and Nina glimpsed the room and the bed, her heart was in her mouth and she tried to step back, the way blocked by Wayne to took her in a bear hug and pushed her into the room. The room itself was lit with a lamp on the side table next to the bed with a black duvet and sheets, floor to ceiling wardrobe with mirrored doors faced the bed, a couple of tasteful reggae poster sat in frames on the walls, soft music played from a music system on the desk and arrayed on the bed were handcuffs, strawberry lubricant and a pink vibrator. Wayne had been upstairs making preparations after they first arrived.

Immediately both men started undressing Nina, lifting her top over her head, Wayne undid her bra and Des pulling down her jeans followed by her now damp panties, it was so quick Nina barely resisted. Nina was wearing a new set of underwear in pale blue, she had thought them daringly sexy for her, but they were quickly stripped off her and left in a small pile of her clothes on the floor. Des and Wayne then stripped their clothes off, their skin dark and cocks large and erect.

Des, took Nina's wrist pulled her to him, his erection touched her engorged vulva making her gasp. He kissed her while Wayne closed the door behind them Nina heard the lock click.

Des and Nina stood in the middle of the room lips locked, Des gently thrusting between her legs. Nina heard a click and a buzzing noise as Wayne came behind her and reaching around pressed the vibrator against her clitoris. Nina jumped in surprise but again was caught between two strong men and was unable to resist.

Withing seconds Nina was gasping in pleasure as the powerful vibrations sapped the last of her resistance and she submitted to these two men.

They led her to the bed pushed her onto it. Wayne gently opened her legs and pressed the vibrator against her womanhood. Des lay next to her, kissing her, and stroking the top half her body. Slowly Nina started to relax, untensing her body and as she did the pleasure started to multiply, she kissed Des back with more passion and closed her legs around the vibrator gripping it fiercely. Wayne had taken out his phone and had set it up next to the bed to record this, he picked it up now and filmed as he slowly inserted the vibrator into Nina's vagina.

After a few minutes of this Des motioned to Wayne and the two men swapped places, Des took her knees and opened up her legs and moved his body between them. Wayne kneeled next to her head, Nina's attention was fixed on Des. "No" said Nina, "I'm not ready", "shush girl" Des replied as he stocked the head of his penis against the lips of her vagina. "No" again Nina said, "you don't have a condom, I'm not on the pill". Des replied softly "Shush, just enjoy this", her pushed the tip of his black cock into her, penetrating her for the first time by a black cock. Nina gasped.

Wayne had been stroking his shaft, now grabbed her head again and turned it towards him, pressing his erection to her lips, silencing her. Des was getting into a rhythm now and Wayne had no difficultly this time in getting Nina to accept his manhood, her took her hand and used it to stroke the bottom of his shaft.

Nina was still in shock, but her body was betraying her, she adjusted her hips between the relentless pounding and lifting her legs up to enhance the pleasure, she closed her eyes picturing the scene of her naked white body, on the black bed, with this black bull of a man taking her, her free arms went pressed against the headboard as she felt Des shudder and she knew he had just shot his semen into her, the knowledge making her orgasmed for the first time.

Des rolled off her and Wayne quickly climbed on, Nina tried to push him away, but the effort was feeble and lacked conviction. Wayne's eager penis soon founder her well lubricated vagina and she started to pump away, Nina found it easier this time. Des took the phone and zoomed in on Nina's face, her face flushed from the first orgasm, her eyes where again closed as she gasped and moaned, eventually putting her arms around Wayne back as he defiled her.

Nina arched her head back as she orgasmed for the second time, seconds later Wayne added his semen to Des's swirling around her vagina. Wayne climbed off her and Nina curled up and her body recovered from the ravishing she had just received. Des pulled up the duvet from underneath her and covered her with it, Wayne took his phone and left the room, while Des lifted the duvet and climbed in next to Nina, she snuggled up next to her, sniffling but attached to his warm body and the smell of him. Exhausted she fell asleep.

She woke up hours later, light from the street lights outside filtered into the silent room. She felt the need to go to the toilet and quietly climbed out of the bed and went in search of the toilet. In the bathroom she silently lowered the toilet seat lid and sat down, she felt semen dripping from her vagina and cleaned herself up, the paper feeling harsh against the sensitive skin of her vulva.

She finished and washed her hands, switching off the lights before she opened the door, as not to wake anyone she gasped when she found Des waiting for her outside on the landing. Silently he took her hand and led her back to his bed. Still naked Nina climbed in and Des followed, he put his arm around her and started to kiss. After a few seconds Nina kissed him back, his hands started stroking her bodying, before zeroing in in her vagina, starting on her clitoris rubbing back and forth and slowly moving down towards her vagina entrance, eventually Nina reached over and took hold of his erect penis.

Des gently rolled Nina onto her side away from him, using his right hand to pull her legs up before pressing his erect penis to her vagina spooning her. He penetrated her again slowly causing Nina to moan in pleasure. Des reach around her to play with her clitoris. Before they had been fast, brutal and frantic, this was now slow, gentle and intimate, Nina put her head back and Des lean over so they could kiss.

It took time but the orgasm built up in Nina, before she could contain it no longer and her body spasmed as the strongest orgasm get hit her, she cried out in extasy. Des was not done yet but he enjoyed the sensation of Nina gripping his penis with the muscles in her vagina. Nina groaned as Des speeded up, her vagina feeling ultra-sensitive, she tried to pull away but Des thrust even harder, pushing her onto her front as he rolled on top of her. The angle of how he entered her now mean that he pressed against Nina's G-spot and unbelievable another orgasm grew inside the subjugated girl. She gripped the pillow as waves of pleasure developed her. Des roared as he came and shuddered violently, this tipped Nina over the edge and she nearly passed out.

Des wiped his dripped penis with tissue from the side table and turned to find Nina already asleep.

The morning after Nina woke up alone, judging from the sun she knew it must be late, she lay for a few minutes collecting her thoughts. Remembering the wild night of sex and the things she had done, things she would never have considered before. She remembered surrendering and being utterly dominated, she unconsciously started to touch herself.

After a few minutes she got out of bed, found a robe hanging against the back of the door and crept out, the house sounded empty and silent, she went to the bathroom again and took a shower and cleaned herself up. She looked in the mirror, somehow expecting to look different, but her familiar face looked back at her. She dried herself and went back to the bedroom to search for her clothes. She found them rumpled and stuffed in a cupboard. Full dressed she checked the time on her phone, several messages waited for her, but she was anxious now. She descended the stairs, remembering last night and what had happened here, she remembered they had not used condoms and tried to recall how many times they can cum inside her.

No one was downstairs so she let herself out and started to walk, she did not know where she was but knew roughly the direction. 20 minutes later she came to a local shopping centre and took a taxi the rest of the way home. Once there she made herself some tea and ate a bowl of breakfast cereal distractedly followed by another shower, first having dumped her clothes in the washing. She could spell the semen on her knickers and she was half revolted and half aroused by it.

She dressed in her PJs and climbed into bed. She lay there thinking about what happened. Eventually she felt sleepy and drifted into a deep dreamless sleep.

She woke in the early evening, the sky just beginning to darken. She checked her phone and her messages, several from her friends from last night checking she got home safely, the last messages from a number she did not recognise. She opened the first one to find a list of club nights, and her heart raced, the next was a video, she opened it shocked to hear a voice she recognised as her own crying out in pleasure, thin white limbs stuck out from underneath a muscular backside and then her face, eyes closed, mouth open as she orgasmed.

Then the final message, an address, a time and his name.

The video Des had sent her and she had opened Saturday evening had shocked her beyond belief, her emotions had gone from horror, shame to arousal, and late that night eventually her resolve broke and she watched the full video, her fingers seemingly of their own accord slipping under the lip of her PJs and fingering her aroused clitoris, before rubbing the length of her vulva and masturbating herself to orgasm.

She felt both aroused and disgusted with herself afterwards but quickly fell asleep.

Sunday Nina woke late after a troubled night, and kept looking at Des's text message, willing herself to delete them but unable to. Her mind kept thinking back to her being ravished by two older powerful strong black men. Nothing in her rather sheltered life had prepared her for that, and though she hated it, the thought of surrendering to the ravishing aroused her more than she could have through possible.

Had she been able to think straight she would have considered how expectations of her had shaped who she was, and how being able to escape all that weight of expectation and to surrender to her desires was exhilarating and guilt free.

After getting up later than usual she showered and dressed in her frumpiest sports cloths and made breakfast, after eating half a bowl of cereal and throwing the rest in the recycling bucket, she tried to study and failed abysmally to get anything constructive done, even after switching off her phone and hiding it under her pillow.

So Nina ended up going for a walk to try and clear her head. She headed across Pewley Down one of her favourite walks and walked much further than usual. She arrived back in town early evening tired and not having eaten all day she decided to eat out and ended up in Zizzis a Italian casual restaurant who often went to with her girlfriends.

After a glass of wine, she took out her phone which she had been resisting looking at all afternoon and switched it on, the phone buzzed as the messages came through but no messages from Des. She put it down, unwillingly feeling disappointed, and thought for a few minutes, her starter arrived and she ordered a second glass of white.

Des was visited by his daughter on Sunday, Tia lived with her mother in London and was working now, she wanted a car for her 21st Birthday. Tia teased him playfully over the vegan lunch he had prepared for then and how tofu was not "proper food".

Tia was not his only child, but the only one he had known, and he was a protective and loving father.

At 42 Des was fit, and easily passed for a much younger man, apart from the occasional joint he drank little and due to his jobs as a fitness instructor and salsa teacher was extremely fit.

Des was a player, he had the body that many women fantasied about, and the dark completion that was alluring and mysterious, but most of all, years of dancing had given him a grace and fluidity which his conquests found arousing and made them susceptible to his charms. Then there was his penis, large not only in length but also girth, women wanted to find out how it would feel inside them.

It's not that he did not want to settle down but a stream of women wished to be bedded by him and he saw no reason to change.

He had tried it all, and sought out new sexual adventures to excite him. Though there was a recurring theme to his conquests. Years of racism, not just the in your face kind, but the "polite" British racism, the passive aggressive hostility, and effected snide comments, precision twists of the blade, deniable as overt racism but leaving the meaning clear had affected him and bedding white women was his kink, his own personal justice, a way to bring balance, but not just sex, he wanted to dominate them. Des would never have dream of raping anyone, but he knew about women's desire and the type who wanted to be controlled by him.

After Tia left, Des went shopping to prepare for the week ahead. While in Waitrose, considering the various choices of humus he received a text message. He was mildly surprised to see it was from Nina, he recalled with a smile Friday night with her. He read the message "Hi Des, It's Nina, Thanks for the club recommendations".

He thought about her, her slim fit body, but also her education and clear intelligence, the prospect of her excited him, he could feel a semi erection already. The subtext of the message was clear enough, he smiled again and opted for the low-fat humus with grilled peppers, it would go nicely with a medley of raw vegetables as a light supper before vigorous exercise.

The doorbell buzzed shortly after 9pm. Nina has been sitting nervously in her kitchen a cup of mint tea half drunk and growing cold in front of her. She had tried on several different outfits over the course of the last 2 hours and had settled on something casual, she was switching between regretting sending the half-drunk text and desperately wanting Des to arrive. The buzz of the doorbell made her jump, her heart thumped, and her mouth went dry, she froze.

The bell buzzed again and she snapped out of her distraction and went to the door. She turned the lock and slowly pulled the door open, her breathing almost having stopped.

Des stood there his toned body hidden by a dark hoodie, "Hi Nina" he said smiling and he moved forward reaching out to her.

Saying nothing Nina took a half step back to let him in. He wrapped his arms around her and pulled her slim body to him and kissed her hard. Nina was taller than average and the same height as Des, and there was something reminiscing of being in bed with someone when the kiss is level. The shock felt almost electric.

After a few seconds Nina relaxed and put her arms around Des's neck and kissed him back with passion. Des pushed the door shut with his foot, as Nina let go of him.

"Hi Des" she said taking a gasp of air, welcome to my home", she stood there embarrassed and shy not knowing what to say.

"Glad you messaged me" Des said, "You look great".

Nina's heart thudded when she heard him say this. "You want me to come in" Des asked.

Flustered Nina took his hand and not knowing what do in this situation Nina took him into the living room, Des took in the room, tidy well organised, clean with a work station with all her study books put away but still visible, Yes this was a fantasy of his, the good girl gone wild.

Des sat on the tasteful cream soft as Nina fiddled with the controller to put on some music. She came over to the sofa, and Des made a playful grab at her arm and pulled her onto his lap, Nina squeaked in surprise but embraced him and they kissed.

"I was not sure if I had scared you on Friday" Des finally said, Nina said nothing. In fact she had been scared and still was but did not want to admit to this.

Instead she said "Do you want anything" thinking to fetch them both drinks.

"Yes I do, Des said moving his hands up under her top and started exploring her body. His touch made Nina feel amazing, Des found the clasp on her bra and one handed opened it. Nina felt the release and responded by pulling her top and bra over her head, and astonished at her bravery stared into Des face to see if he liked what he saw.

Des had been planning through the events of Friday all the way here and was highly aroused. He lent down and sucked on each of her breasts one by one knowing that it would release the hormone Oxytocin, the love hormone which would make Nina feel bonded to him.

They kissed some more as Des's hands roamed freely around her body, constantly going back to her breasts to stimulate that all important love hormone.

Eventually Des got Nina to move off his lap and sit on the sofa next to him, he stood up and undid his trousers and boxers which dropped to the floor and out sprang his erect penis.

"Its so big" Nina said unaware of the cliché and hesitantly touched it, before taking a firmer grip and stroking it up and down. "I can't believe that fits in me" she whispered it Des.

Des reached around her neck to gently guide her head down onto his lap and she willingly let him and started to suck on his penis while still stocking the bottom of his shaft.

After a couple of minutes Des knew he would not be able to hold on much longer and lifted Nina off his cock. She stood up and Des un-popped the button on her jeans her jeans and pulled them down along with her knickers, Nina just watching him undress her tingling with anticipation and admiring his firm body, and stepped out of the jeans leaving them a small pile next to the sofa.

Nina expecting to go to the bedroom but Des roughly grabbed her and pulled her back on the sofa, which Nina obediently let him as he pushed her back before mounting her, one of Des's legs kneeling on the sofa and the other braced on against the floor. Des lifted her right leg and rubbed his erection against her.

Nina was pinned against the sofa, as Des half crouched over her, one leg on the sofa the other on the floor, Nina felt his erect penis against her leg, and she thought of the fact it did not have a condom on and she was not on the pill, but then his penis's head was pressing against her and all other thoughts aside from desire fled her head.

A slow thrust and he was inside her, her vagina slick from desire. Nina closed her eyes concentrating hard on the weight of his body the smell and the feeling of the thick hard penis taking her. Des gave quick hard thrusts which jerked Nina's whole body, she braced herself against Des's body and gave into being ravished.

She came twice before Des did, she felt him jerk as he came and imagined his seed inside her. He rested, still inside her. Nina had her arm around his neck and looked at him willing him to smile, he caught he eye and did.

"That was beautiful" he said "you feel so good".

Nina pouted slightly. Des grinned and kissed her, grinding his semi erect penis inside her causing her to moan. Des found this arousing and slowly gently started to thrust, his erection again hardening, Nina was surprised but let it was pleasant as she was so wet inside. Until unbelievably for the third time she came, more deeply than she ever had before, digging her fingers into Des's back.

Des pay on top of Nina, stroking her hair, his penis still inside her. He whispered in her ear and the closeness make it feel so intimate to Nina. Finally he reluctantly pulled his semi erect penis from inside her, leaving a strain it would take Nina a week to get out of the sofa and would forever remember when she sat on that spot.

Exhausted from their lovemaking, the couple went to bed, Nina leading the way upstairs and shyly showing her house.

"Sorry if it's a bit messy," Nina said, glancing around nervously.

Des smiled reassuringly. "It looks great. Really cozy."

Nina blushed. "Thanks. You can use the bathroom after me. I'll just be a minute."

"Take your time," Des replied, leaning against the doorframe as he watched her go in.

Nina smelled of sweat and sex and Des's semen was leaking out of her vagina, she quickly cleaned herself up and showered, feeling the warm water wash away her anxiety. When she stepped out, she found Des waiting patiently.

"All yours," she said, wrapping a towel around herself.

Des nodded and kissed her on the forehead. "Thanks, beautiful. I'll be quick."

Des showered and used Nina's toothbrush joined her in her bed. He was amused to see her bedroom was girly pink and climbed into her bed under a pink duvet. Nina was already in bed in her PJs, she considered being naked but thought she would not be able to sleep.

She was sleepy and warm, and Des snuggled up to her, starting to get an erection. Nina felt his hardness pressing against her thigh and smiled contentedly. Des switched off the lamp and they drowsily talked before falling into a deep relaxed sleep.

The week had gone slowly, and work had lost some of its interest. Nina spent her days trying to work and not daydream and the evenings sexting with Des. On Wednesday she had slipped out during lunch time by herself and had gone to Boux Avenue and brought herself new underwear, She had picked out a racy pink body herself when the sales assistant had talked her into buying a purple bra knickers and suspenders set. Being shy she placed these in Marks and Spencer's bags before she returned to the office.

Later that evening she tried them on and looked at herself in the full-length mirror. On a whim she took out her phone and took a picture of herself and sent it to Des. As she dressed her phone pinged and she grabbed her phone from the bed to look at the message. It was a picture of a large and very erect penis.

All week Nina had been waiting for an invitation from Des to meet up, several times she started to write a message to ask him, but never sent it. Finally, Des messaged "Hi Nina, Want another wild night"

Nina's stomach flipped when she read this, she thought this over. What did he mean, both times she had been with Des were wild for her, but what did "wild" mean to Des? She still fantasied about the first night, with two men. She relished the sense of being controlled and surrender to two dominate black men, she closed her eyes and relived being penetrated by two penises simultaneously.

She texted back with shaking hands, "yes" and she meant it.

Friday, she rushed through her work and left as early as she dared and raced home to shower and change. She was torn between the bodysuit and the suspenders before opting for the bodysuit. She dressed, grabbed her bag with her overnight things and went outside to wait for the taxi. She took the train to Wimbledon finding the journey intolerably long. After an hour the train arrived in the station and she briskly walked to the taxi rank, giving the address from the phone.

Nina arrived shortly after at the restaurant and called Des, he came out quickly and took her by her hand to a booth at the back on the restaurant, Nina was surprised to see Wayne again, who flashed her a brilliant grin that left her feeling both surprised and aroused. Des introduced her to the others in the group. Wayne Nina knew from the previous week, Kelly was Wayne's girlfriend which worried Nina, and then there was Marcus and Adam.

Nina was guided by Des to sit next to Kelly and she seated himself at the end next to Nina, they called across the waitress and without asking ordered another glass for Nina and an extra pitcher of cocktail. Des wanted her relaxed and uninhibited for later.

Kelly was a law student in her second year and a year younger than Nina, living in London and was chatty, exuding the confidence of an expensive education, except when talking to Wayne, where she blushed and stumbled over her words. While Kelly slim she was had bigger breasts that Nina, her top was revealing, and Nina was slightly envious. She relaxed a little as she chatted with Kelly despite worrying that she had had sex the previous week with her boyfriend.

It was a fun evening with lots of laughter and Nina quickly relaxed and joined in the banter. She enjoyed the proximity of Des and pressed her leg against his. Des responded by putting his arm around Nina and she snuggled against him. The food arrived and was consumed, more drinks came and it was late before anyone realised. Marcus invited everyone around to his place nearby.

The group arrived back at a terraced house halfway down a road 15 minutes' walk from the restaurant, they had stopped at the supermarket to stock up on drinks and the group was in high spirits as they arrived. Des had his arm around Nina during the walk to the house and Nina was feeling great and relaxed. She was falling for Des and the company of others including Kelly diminished any concerns about how wild things would get. She was just hoping her and Des would spend the night together again.

After sorting out their purchase in the kitchen, most of the group went into the living room and Marcus put on some music. There were not enough seats and Des pulled Nina onto his lap.

"Comfortable?" Des asked, wrapping his arms around Nina.

Nina laughed and nodded. "Always am with you."

Adam remained in the kitchen to bring in the drinks. The men kept to beer and low alcohol drinks, while Adam mixed up strong vodka-based fruity cocktails for Kelly and Nina.

"Hey Adam, need any help?" Kelly called from the living room, noticing he was taking his time.

Adam shook his head with a grin. "Nope, I got this! Just making sure your drinks are perfect."

Kelly laughed, "You know us too well. But hurry up, we need our bartender here!"

Marcus looked up from fiddling with the music player. "What are you making us listen to, man?" he teased. "Something good, I hope."

"Don't worry, it's a classic," Marcus replied, as the soft rap filled the room.

Adam walked in with a tray of drinks, distributing beers to the guys and handing the colourful cocktails to Kelly and Nina. "Here you go, ladies. Enjoy!"

Kelly took a sip and her eyes widened. "Wow, Adam, this is amazing. What's in it?"

Adam winked. "A little bit of this, a little bit of that. Secret recipe."

Nina raised her glass. "Cheers to secret recipes, then!"

The group clinked their glasses together, a chorus of "Cheers!" filling the room.

As they settled into their drinks and conversation, the atmosphere became relaxed and lively. Kelly leaned over to Nina. "So, how's everything going with you two?" she asked, nodding toward Des.

Nina smiled, glancing at Des. "It's going really well, actually."

Des grinned, giving Nina a gentle squeeze. "Right back at you, babe."

Marcus took a swig of his beer. "You two are disgustingly cute, you know that?"

Kelly laughed. "Jealous, much?"

Adam chimed in, "Hey, we're all just here for a good time. No need for jealousy."

"Agreed," Des said. "Tonight's about good friends, good music, and good drinks. Speaking of which, anyone need a refill?"

Kelly held up her empty glass. "I could definitely use another one of those cocktails, if you don't mind, Adam."

Adam took her glass with a mock bow and headed back to the kitchen, the music played on, and the friends continued to enjoy each other's company, the room filled with laughter and conversation.

Marcus took out a plastic Ziplock bag from a cupboard along with a bong and went to fill it from the kitchen. This was handed around. Nina had not used Cannabis before but in the moment, she took a hit and choked, causing everyone to laugh.

"You okay there?" Des asked, patting her back gently.

Nina coughed and nodded, her eyes watering. "Yeah, I'm fine. Just wasn't expecting it to be that strong."

Kelly giggled. "It gets easier, trust me."

Determined, Nina took another hit and felt as if a veil had been lifted, revealing a world tinged with a newfound intensity. Colours seemed to deepen, sounds became more vibrant, and her thoughts took on a dream-like quality. Time seemed to stretch and bend, allowing Nina to sink into a state of relaxation and euphoria.

"Wow," she murmured, her voice soft and awed. "This is... amazing."

Des smiled at her. "Welcome to the club."

Marcus, handing the bong to Adam, nodded in agreement. "Told you it was good stuff."

Nina snapped back into the present when she felt Des's hands around her body. In fact she became aware of 3 hands on her and was surprised to find Wayne's hand on leg while his other hands was on Kelly who was giggling having had a good suck on the bong. She did not seem surprised or seem to mind where her boyfriends hands were.

Drinks were served and the men encouraged both girls to drink, they talked about music, clubs, holidays, it was fun and friendly, and Nina was enjoying herself.

After some time, Des took Nina by the hand and led her to the kitchen. He made them both drinks, adding more vodka to hers than his.

"Here you go," he said, handing her the glass. "Thought you might like it a bit stronger."

"Thanks," Nina replied with a smile, taking a sip. "So, what do you think of the music tonight?"

"It's pretty good," Des said, leaning against the counter. "Marcus always has a good playlist."

They chatted about the music and their friends, but while Nina felt relaxed, she was desperate for Des to give her more attention.

Des felt powerful and in control, he took out a packed of blue pills and squeezed one out and swallowed it in front of Nina, he did not need it of course, but it added to his stamina and made it easier to come back for seconds and thirds. Nina just assumed they were aspirin or something.

"I got new underwear for you" Nina blurted out, it was not something she would have said normally, but the effect of the drink and drugs, the nagging jealously of Kelly and her desire for Des made her far more uninhibited than normal.

"Really?" Des said, "want to give me a little look".

Nina nodded and looked around the kitchen "is there somewhere we can go? Des grinned, and without a word left the room.

He was back a minute later, and put his arms around her to kiss her, Nina heard someone else racing up the stairs. Des took Nina in his arms grabbed her firm buttocks squeezed them and kissed her passionately, Nina felt herself melting in his arms.

Marcus was in his bedroom, it was clean and tidy, his double bed had new sheets and the room was prepared. Marcus switched on his computer and checked one last time the set-up of the four wireless HD webcams, that they light levels in the room were sufficient and there was enough memory on the hard drives and started the webcams to record and then powered down the screen, he used the remote to turn the music on, checked the radiators were warm enough before leaving the room and walking down the stairs checking the live feed on his phone and whistled the first bars of a tune once as he entered the lounge.

Des picked up a bottle of water from the fridge and took Nina by the hand and led her upstairs.

He knew Marcus's room and pushed the door open and went in. Nina followed, excited and apprehensive. She was about to ask Des something, but he cut her off with a kiss before walking across the room and sitting on the bed. "Stipe for me baby".

Music was already playing and Nina swayed in what she hoped was a seductive way. She felt silly lifting her top over her head so stopped trying to dance and concentrated on getting her clothes off. When naked save for her pink bodysuit, she walked over and sat on Des's lap.

Downstairs the group had Nina stripping in 4k definition on the huge television. Kelly was sat on Wayne's lap and Wayne and Adam were making suggestions which caused her to giggle nervously as she watched Nina. Both Wayne and Adam were touching her all over her body.

Back in the bedroom Des had slipped off the straps from the bodysuit and had exposed Nina's breasts which he massaged as they kissed. The camera on the side table caught the best view. Next Des started stroker Nina's inner thigh, Nina opened her legs wider to let his fingers glider higher up her legs. Des found the three poppers at the bottom of the bodysuit and undid them.

Des's hand came up underneath Nina's leg and he slid his index and middle finger up her vulva, to the top of her clitoris which he toyed with, eliciting moans of pleasure from Nina, she involuntary arched her neck and back and Des kissed her neck, knowing that she responded to this. Des shifted his body slightly and moved Nina around as he spread her left leg to expose what he was doing better for the camera on the bedside table.

Des carried on rubbing along the Nina's vulva, which had engorged and slick as her body prepared it self for him. Nina arched her back, lifted her head back and gasped out loud as Des's pace quickened.

Des kissing her neck agin, knowing she liked that and slowly started to edge his fingers into the entrance of her vagina, which opened to his touch. Des moved his hand from under her to over her legs and explored further, moving his wrist so her when he was inside her he could bends his fingers upwards searching for Nina's g-spot, eventually finding the firmer spot along the soft tissue of her vagina and gently but firmly rubbing it, quickly bringing Nina to orgasm.

Downstairs the men clapped end shouted in appreciation. They were all now very aroused, but they would have to wait, now was not quite the right time for them.

For Kelly it was different. "It's time babe." Wayne said to Kelly who go up off his lap and stood up. Wayne followed and took her hand as Adam and Marcus watched her lustfully exit the room.

After getting some water as well, Wayne took Kelly upstairs and after shushing Kelly to keep quiet, he softly opened the door to Marcus's bedroom. Nina now naked and lying on the bed was blindfolded with her hands tied to the head of the bed. Des was stroking her with a faux fur glove.

Wayne equally quietly closed the door behind Kelly, and started to undress her, placing her clothes over the back of the chair by the desk. Wayne led Kelly, naked save for a pair of sky-blue panties to the bed. Des stood up and started undressing himself as did Wayne.

Wayne went around the far side of the bed closest to Nina, he repositioned one of the cameras and leaned across to gently brush Nina's lips with his own. Nina waiting in anticipation opened her mouth and lifted her head willing for Des's lips to find hers, but Wayne was just teasing with her for the moment. Nina had heard the undressing but had not guessed that she and Des were not along. The soft rap music had covered a lot of the sounds.

Meanwhile, Des was kissing Kelly, who had her hand around his thick penis and was stroking it. Des fondled her blonde hair and her neck. This was not the first time Kelly had been with Des and she knew that Wayne got off on watching them have sex. This was however the first time with a girl and while she had been groomed for this, she was nervous. She turned to look at Nina naked and bound, lying prone on the bed, recalled her role in this and nervously bit her lip.

Wayne had positioned his penis next to Nina mouth and lay it across her lips. Nina eagerly opened her mouth and turned her head to get accept it into her mouth and start sucking. Already aroused by this helpless naked young woman in front of him Nina could taste the precum and this excited her even more.

Kelly was also giving fellatio to Des, looking up as he stood over her, hoping to catch his eye. After a minute or so Des motioned to Wayne, who pulled his penis out from Nina's mouth and softly walked around to the end of the bed and climbed between Nina's open legs, gently prising them further open. His tongue gently licked along Nina's vulva its tip exploring and seeking out the sensitive nub of her clitoris. Nina strained against her restraints, the soft ropes gave little, and it felt amazing to be caught like, free to enjoy this.

Des and Kelly watched as Wayne carried on licking and sucking on Nina's clitoris, mesmerised by the erotic sight. Soon Des took Kelly by the hand, and she stood up, the stepped closer to Wayne, their footsteps muffled by the carpet.

Des touched Wayne on the shoulder and Wayne gave one last suck and moved back. Kelly moved in between Nina's legs and hesitantly gave Nina's vulva a lick. It did not taste bad, tangy with a hint of sweetness, and this encouraged Kelly. She licked some more and was rewarded with a deep sensuous sigh from Nina.

Kelly still in her sky blue knickers, wiggled her buttocks in the air as she concentrated on pleasuring Nina. Des and Wayne stood back and watched, they did not need their phones, 4 HD cameras were recording this along with a microphone next to the bed.

After a couple of minutes Kelly had found her rhythm with Nina. Kelly was also getting aroused and could feel her panties getting soaked. Nina's started panting as an orgasm built up inside her, she started moaning loudly and bucked as she climaxed, releasing more vaginal fluids onto Kellys lips.

Des sat next to Nina, and undid the ropes as he kissed her, before picking her up in her arms, Nina felt movement in the bed to her left and pulled of the blindfold. She was surprised to see Kelly and Wayne kissing passionately but Des pulled her face back so he could kiss her and started stroking her back. Still shocked Nina responded to this and did not flinch when she felt other hands stroking her. The hand was softer than those of the men in the room and Nina became aware that it was Kelly's hand. She was passed caring on such details.

Des rolled Nina onto her back and tried the ropes again with the help of Wayne. Kelly then straddled Nina and Nine felt her light weight and soft skin on her midriff.

"What's happening?" Nina asked. Kelly responded by leaning down and kissing Nina full on the lips. Nina was shocked but there was something nice about the softness, and the touch of Kelly's breasts against hers, not to mention the effects of the drugs and alcohol. She closed her eyes and kissed back noticing how different it felt to kiss a girl, only to be surprised again by Kelly's tongue hesitantly exploring her mouth.

After a few moments Des and Wayne gently removed the restraints from Nina and Wayne picked up the camera from the desk to film them closer. Both girls were caught up in the moment, and were oblivious. Nina had her hand on the back of Kelly's head and opened her eye to look for Des, who was standing there grinning as he enjoyed the show, white skin on white skin, blonde and brunette hair on the pillow.

The door opened and Marcus and Adam came in. Marcus made a bee line for Nina's clothes and picked up her bodysuit and smelt it. "Damn she was wet" Marcus said after feeling the crotch area of the lingerie.

Adam meanwhile was stripping and stroking his erect penis as he watched the two girls. Des took out a curved pink vibrator from the side table and interrupting the two girls gave it to Nina.

Slightly startled Nina broke off from Kelly to look at what she had been given, "You want me to use it?" she asked as she sat up from the bed.

Des replied "Use it on Kelly, she just make you cum so it's her turn", Nina blushed realising what had happened.

"But I am not gay" Nina replied.

Kelly sat next to Nina smiling with excitement and legs open, still playing with Nina's nipples as instructed before hand.

Des sat down on the bed next to Nina, she still clutched the sex toy, he kissed her hard and his right reached out to hers and with a deft hand switched the vibrator on. He pressed her down onto the bed next to Kelly, Nina gave no resistance.

Des stifled her next protest with a kiss as Marcus took another sex toy from a box on the shelf and sat down on the bottom of the bed close to Nina's legs, Des took it from him and started to rub the pink egg-shaped toy along her vulva.

Marcus took his phone from his trousers and opened the app to control the toy. He remotely switched the vibrator on as Des used it to gently penetrate her vagina, causing Nina to shudder and sign deeply.

Soon the toy was deep inside her with just a pink tail sticking out of vagina, bright against the smooth white skin. Des moved his head down and started kissing and sucking in Nina's breasts as Kelly lifting herself onto her elbows started to kiss Nina on her lips. After a few seconds Nina surrender her inhibitions, relaxed a little and kissed her back.

The rest was easy, Des guided Nina's hand towards Kelly's crotch. Kelly opened her legs to accept the toy, she grunted as Nina missed and both girls giggled as Kelly helped Nina guide the length of the toy into her, the giggle turned into a gasp from Kelly as the curved toy touched her sensitive g-spot.

Des stood up and joined Marcus and Adam as they started playing with the controls the vibrator inside Nina. Marcus used the touch screen to raise it to maximum vibrations, resulting in a surprised squeal from Nina, who lifted her head to give them a pretend hard stare which turned into a sloppy smile. She never would have dreamed she would enjoy this, but she did, performing for these men turned her on, and kissing Kelly was very pleasant and not what she imagined.

Kelly was loudly moaning and Nina went back to kissing her, she used her free hand to touch Kelly's breasts, before rolling over and raising herself on all fours, her pert buttocks in view of the men. Kelly's hand reached Nina's and Kelly guided Nina to touch her most sensitive spots. Inside Nina the egg buzzed in different patterns as first Marcus and then Des played with it.

Kelly climaxed and this was the signal for all four men who had endured all they could take and wanted the girls.

All four men climbed on the double bed, Marcus and Wayne at the top went on their knees, Marcus stuffing the pillow under his buttocks for support, Nina was faced with Marcus's erect black penis which she took in her mouth while wishing it was Des's.

Wayne and Des manhandled Kelly onto all fours, as Adam pulled out the vibrator from Nina and grasping Nina's buttocks tried to enter her, after two misses Nina reached around to help guide him into her, she had no idea who it was inside her but she hoped it was Des.

She looked up and was relieved to see it was Wayne being given a blowjob by Kelly and not her Des. Adam was thrusting long powerful stokes so she concentrated on keeping Marcus's Penis in her mouth.

Kelly was receiving similar brutal treatment as Des pounded her. Kelly had long lost her inhibitions with these men and vocalised her pleasure.

After a few minutes they men swapped. Marcus now lay on the bed and Nina was told to mount him, she saw it was Adam who had been inside her, but he was now next to Kelly, Des stood on the bed grinning and moved closer to Nina, as she tried to figure out what she was meant to do as she straddled Marcus.

She lowered herself down arms balanced on his chest and Marcus frantically aroused managed to get inside her and started thrusting, while raising his knees to give Nina more support. She moaned as she had never had sex like this before and this position reached parts never before touched. Des positioned himself closer and Nina tried to take his penis as well, but it was tricky and she just held onto it while Marcus kept thrusting below her.

It was not really working for Des so threaded he way to the end of the bed between the two couples he went to the nightstand and opened it, inside was everything need for an orgy. Des found what he wanted and closed the draw. He went around the other side of the bed next to Marcus and Nina.

"Hey Marcus, hey Marcus" Des called to get his attention, "Lets double up" he held up the bottle of sex lubricant. Marcus grinned and nodded. Des climbed on the bed behind Nina, and gently pushed her forward, Nina recovering from a near orgasm was surprised and wondered what was next,

Marcus was still in her but had stopped pounding her. She felt something cool and jelly like on her bum and then felt Des's thumb in her anus, she squealed in surprise and tried to look around but Marcus held her arms limiting her movement.

Nina felt Des's hand grip her hip, then his hard shaft touching her buttocks, she was surprised as she was sat on Marcus with Marcus's penis inside her, she felt more liquid being poured between her buttocks cheeks and the pressure of Des's hard penis on her anus, it built until it was too much and he penetrated her slippery lubricated anus, Nina squealed with shock.

Marcus started thrusting again but more gentle, his hands caressed Nina's breasts, flicking her erect nipple's. Equally gently Des used her buttocks. Between these two toned black bodies Nina could do nothing, the thought of her helplessness excited her and she started to enjoy the sensation of being impaled on two penises.

Adam was using the webcam like a movie camera. At a suggestion from Marcus he took a exercise step from the wardrobe and placed it next to the bed and stood on it to give him extra height. "Now suck his dick girl" Marcus demanded. After a moments hesitation Nina complied, leaning down to take Adams penis, knowing she had three penises inside her.

It did not occur to her that she was being far more wild now than the girls she has privately considered "sluts" in school and college and if it had she would not have cared.

The triple penetration did not last long, She struggled to keep Adam's penis in her mouth and gave up as Des and Marcus got more vigorous. The tension in Nina had been building and she had repeatably plateaued before the men changing position had delayed her.

Now she realised she could slightly adjust her position so that Marcus penis was causing maximum impact, and Des stroking her back, she got into the rhythm with her two lovers and orgasmed crying out as she did, her muscles in her vagina tight from all the sports she did gripped Marcus's penis sending him over the edge and shooting sticky hot cum into her unguarded cervix. Shortly after Des unloaded his seed into her bum.

Nina got up off Marcus quickly, she realised she really needed to wee.

While she sat on the toilet, she tried to make sense of the night, and whose cum was leaking from her. She new she had given blow jobs to Adam, and Marcus, sex with Marcus and she thought Adam, and then Des in her bum. Only Wayne left she thought as she tidied herself up, she hurried as Des was knocking on the door wanting to clean up.

As she re-entered the bedroom, Kelly was on her back with Wayne on top of her, her legs wrapped around him, she moaned and called out Wayne's name. Adam had picked up one of the webcams and was filming the scene again, but put the camera down when he noticed Nina, slim and naked and took hold of her, rubbing his erection against her vulva. Nina was transfixed by the sight of Kelly and Wayne and imagined herself being rutted like that.

Adam had not come yet and needed to, so we pushed her back to the desk, and lifted her on to it and started to spread her legs apart, Des came up behind him and smiled approvingly at her. Nina reached out her hand to him and they touched as Adam entered her. Nina watched Des over Adam's shoulder as Adam pounded against her shaking the table under her.

Kelly and Wayne finished and Kelly came over to watch just as Adam shuddered climaxing and adding his seed to Nina. He withdrew and went to clean himself up, and Des put his arms around Nina who grasped him closely and rested her head against his chest. Des found her vulnerability like this deeply arousing.

Des called Wayne over from resting on the bed. He came over grinning and vigorously masturbating to get his erection back. Des slapped him on the back as Wayne approached Nina and spread her legs. Wayne penetrated her once more, but he was spent and after a few thrusts pulled out.

"We all fucked both of them" Des enquired, Marcus responded by saying that he had not had sex with Kelly yet.

Kelly grimaced but let Marcus lead her to the bed where we mounted her. Des put his arms around Nina again and she stood up, shakily and they embraced. "I'm tired" Nina said.

"We'll go to bed soon babe", Des told her, "just you and me?" Nina asked.

"Sure." Des replied.

Like Wayne, Marcus was mostly spent and rolled off Kelly without either of them cumming. Adam yawned and declared he was going to bed.

"Your getting old mate." Wayne declared.

"Nah, I have to be up 9am class tomorrow at the sports centre, right whose sleeping where.?" Adam asked "There is the sofa bed downstairs and my room".

"Shotgun on sofabed" Des called out.

Kelly now next to Wayne whispered in his ear who shook his head, "I'm with Kelly tonight" he stated.

"Adam why don't they sleep with you tonight then" Marcus said, "my room needs a bit of tidying and you will be out early.

Kelly detached herself from Wayne, and grabbed Nina, "let's get showed, these guys will use up all the hot water", she took towels from a draw and lead the way out of Marcus's room.

Nina was confused now, and did not know what to say to the first girl she had ever had a sexual experience with, unable to think of anything to say she politely asked "do you want to go first?" motioning to the shower.

"We can go together" Kelly replied and opened the shower door. Both girls were slim and the shower was spacious. The hot water felt glorious and refreshing, washing away the sweat from Nina's skin.

Kelly took a bottle of shower jell and poured some onto a sponge and started to wash Nina with it from the neck down. Nina alert now watched her as he soaped her breasts and put her arms around her to clean her back. Kelly caught her eye and smiled. "It was fun, I hope you enjoyed it, I enjoyed it" she said. Nina just blushed and said nothing.

The truth was she had enjoyed it, including watching Des have sex with Kelly but most surprising of all she had enjoyed playing with Kelly (she refused to think of it as sex).

Kelly slid the sponge between Nina's legs and gently pressed upwards. More semen dribbled out of her vagina and Kelly squeezed the sponge a couple of times before reapplying the soap and handing Nina the sponge. Nina sponged Kelly all over, ending up washing her crotch as well.

She caught Kelly's eye who smiled and lent forward and kissed her, before grinning as the door to the shower opened, "Hello dirty boys" Kelly said smiling, Nina turned to see Des with Wayne behind him smiling broadly.

Des held up a clean bath towel and Nina stepped into it. "Hope we are not interrupting." Des said.

He slipped past Nina and entered the shower, Kelly came out and Wayne passed her a towel the couple left, Nina dried herself watching Des hum in the shower. She took a dry towel left of the loo seat as Des turned the water off and handed it to him.

"I hope you enjoyed it tonight Nina" he said "I can't tell you how erotic it was watching you", Nina said nothing and tied her towel around her body before helping Des dry himself.

"Were you filming that?" she asked eventually.

"Yes" Des replied with a shrug.

"who will see that" Nina asked.

Des chuckled a deep sexy chuckle which Nina liked so much. "Just us." Des said without elaborating on how he meant by us.

"It is very sexy watching it back", he took her jaw with his hand and made her look into his eyes. "I think you liked the video I sent you".

Although embarrassed to admit it Nina nodded, he kissed her "come on, lets get dry and into bed, just the two of us. Des said.

Des lead Nina away after grabbing a duvet from Marcus's cupboard. They went to the living room and Des put the bed up while Nina found her bags and put on a negligee and tidied up the room.

Once in the kitchen she took a bottle of water from the fridge and sipped it slowly, thinking again over the events of tonight. It was too much to take in. Des called her and her heart skipped a beat, she smiled and went to him.

Spring had turned to summer and with that Nina's romance with Des had blossomed. They saw each other at least a couple of times a week and although Nina had never imaged herself with an older black man she was smitten with him, despite Des's sexual demands, which included letting his friends sleep with Nina and often filming it.

Her younger sister Lara was coming to spend her holiday with her. Lara was a 1st year veterinary student. Like her sister, she had always studied hard, and across the board got top marks. At 19 she was slender, tall, and somewhat shy, more introverted than her sister. With the same body shape and brunette hair she a casual observer could guess they were sisters. Lara had never had a boyfriend partly because her parents would not have approved while she was studying and partly because she was too shy. Because of that, she was a virgin.

Nina was stressed, she wanted to introduce the love of her life to her family. But there was no way they would approve of Des, not his age, he being twice her age, nor the fact that he had a daughter two months younger than her. Lara was the first step, bringing her sister into her confidence. However, she was also jealous of the open relationship they had, she loved Des. She wanted him all to herself and was jealous of the thought of her sister getting attention from Des.

Des on the other hand liked Nina a lot, but to call it love would be to push the definition. He found her intelligence and class beguiling and her willingness to be dominated by was arousing and convenient. Most of all Des liked the feel of creampies in Nina, he liked seeing his semen dripping out of her vagina, and her using a tissue to wipe between her legs to catch all his seed leaking out of her. But he wanted more, he wanted to breed her. The thought of this intelligent girl impregnated and with his baby growing inside her was a fantasy he had. His fantasies were taking shape into actions.

He had spoken to a friend about this and based on his advice ordered a fertility drug called Clomifene citrate from an online pharmacy based in China, disguised as the same brand of contraceptive pills Nina used. Clomifene would increase Nina's fertility hormones. Des paused before he ordered, he had a vague feeling that this might be illegal, but decided to push on, after all, he was not hurting Nina he felt. The ethical aspect did not even cross his mind.

Two weeks later the packet arrived from China and as his first gym class of the day was not until later, he took the keys Nina had given to him, drove to her house and let himself in, knowing she would be at work. He went to her bathroom and searched the drawers.

Des found the packet of contraceptive pills, in the cupboard behind the mirror, where he had seen them before, he noted their position in the cupboard before taking them out. He popped out the same number of pills from his fake pack, slid them back into the box and replaced them in the cupboard. The two packets were almost identical.

He felt a pang of guilt but thought about the next time he would cum inside her and started to get an erection. He had a hunch, and the bin next to the toilet confirmed it. Nina just had her period. Two weeks from now she would be ovulating...

Just over a week later Nina was at the train station to meet Lara her sister, Nina stood on the crowded platform, her eyes scanning the bustling crowd for any sign of her sister. The rhythmic clatter of the train wheels began to slow as the train pulled into the station. Her heart fluttered with anticipation, knowing that Lara's arrival marked the start of a much-needed break from university for her sister and a couple of weeks of cherished time together.

As the train doors slid open, a stream of passengers flowed out. Then, Nina spotted Lara, her face lighting up with a wide smile. She waved enthusiastically, and Lara's eyes met hers, reflecting the same excitement. They rushed towards each other, hugging tightly.

"I've missed you so much!" Nina exclaimed, pulling back to look at Lara.

"Me too," Lara replied, her eyes sparkling with joy. "It's so good to be here. I can't wait to relax and just have some fun."

They made their way out of the station, chatting animatedly about their plans for the week. "I'll be working until Thursday," Nina explained, "but I've taken Thursday and Friday off, so we'll have a long weekend together."

"That sounds perfect," Lara said. "We can we go into London? Go shopping, maybe even go clubbing. I've been dying to try some new places."

They walked to a nearby café for lunch, the conversation flowing easily between them. Over sandwiches and coffee, Nina felt a mix of excitement and nerves. She had been waiting for the right moment to tell Lara about her boyfriend.

"There's something I want to tell you," Nina said, her voice tinged with shyness. "I've met someone. His name is Des, and I really want you to meet him."

Lara's eyes widened with curiosity. "A boyfriend? Nina, that's wonderful! Tell me everything about him."

Nina blushed, smiling softly. "He's amazing. Kind, funny, and really hot. I think you'll like him. I was hoping we could all get together while you're here."

"Of course! I'd love to meet him," Lara said warmly. "I'm so happy for you, Nina."

The rest of their lunch was filled with talk of plans for the week and stories about Alex. Nina felt a sense of relief and happiness, knowing that Lara would soon meet someone who had become so important to her.

After they dropped Lara's bags at her house Nina took Lara out for a walk.

As the sun set, casting a warm glow over the city, Nina and Lara strolled along the riverside, enjoying the rare opportunity to catch up. The day had been great, but there was something Nina had been holding back, something she knew she needed to share with her sister.

They found a quiet bench overlooking the water and sat down. Nina took a deep breath, gathering her thoughts. "Lara, there's something I need to tell you about Des."

Lara turned to her, curiosity in her eyes. "What is it?"

Nina hesitated, her fingers fidgeting with the hem of her jacket. "Des is... older than me. Quite a bit older, actually."

Lara's eyebrows arched in surprise. "Oh? How much older are we talking?"

Nina swallowed, her gaze fixed on the river. She decided to round down Des's age. "He's 14 years older than me. He's 35." Thirties sounded a lot less scary than forties.

There was a moment of silence as Lara processed this information. Nina could feel her heart pounding in her chest, anxious about how her sister would react.

"Wow," Lara finally said, her tone thoughtful. "I didn't expect that. But... are you happy with him, Nina?"

Nina looked up, meeting Lara's eyes. "I am, Lara. He's kind, and supportive, and we have a great connection. I know the age difference might seem strange, but it doesn't feel that way when we're together."

Lara nodded slowly, a small smile forming on her lips. "If you're happy, then I'm happy for you. Age is just a number if the relationship is strong and healthy."

Nina let out a sigh of relief, feeling a weight lift off her shoulders. "Thank you, Lara. I was worried about how you'd react. I really care about Des, and it means a lot to me that you understand. There is one other thing, he is Black"

Lara paused, not quite sure how to process this information, Lara was not racist in anyway, but their parents were, well she would describe them as old fashioned. Lara reached out, squeezing Nina's hand reassuringly. "You deserve to be happy, Nina. As long as he treats you well, that's all that matters."

Nina smiled, gratitude filling her heart. "He does, Lara. He really does."

They sat in companionable silence for a while, watching the river flow by, the bond between them strengthened by the shared trust and understanding.

"Are you sleeping together" Lara finally asked.

After a long pause, Nina replied simply "Yes".

Neither said anything for a couple of minutes. Lara broke the silence "What's it like?"

Nina closed her eyes "Incredible" she replied.

Wednesday evening came and that evening Nina was introducing Des to her boyfriend for the the first time. Nina fidgeted with her napkin as she and Lara settled into their seats at the restaurant. Her eyes darted towards the entrance every few seconds, her heart racing with a mix of excitement and nerves. She had been looking forward to this moment--introducing her sister to her boyfriend, Des--but now that it was happening, she couldn't shake her anxiety.

"Nina, relax," Lara said, giving her sister a reassuring smile. "I'm sure Des is wonderful."

Nina nodded, forcing a smile. "I hope you two get along. It means a lot to me."

Just then, the door swung open, and Des walked in. He spotted them immediately and made his way over, his easy smile putting Nina slightly at ease. He greeted them both with a warm hug.

"Lara, it's great to finally meet you. Nina's told me so much about you," Des said, his eyes twinkling with genuine interest.

"It's nice to meet you too, Des," Lara replied, smiling back.

As they settled into conversation, Nina felt her nerves begin to melt away. Des was his usual charming self, engaging Lara with stories and making her laugh. It wasn't long before they were all chatting comfortably, the initial awkwardness forgotten.

While they waiting for their food, Des excused himself and went to the bathroom. Lara looked over to Nina and said conspiratorially "Wow, he is so handsome, I never would have believed he was 34". Lara who had never had a proper boyfriend was now very curious about men, especially self-confident fit older men, just like her sister.

However, as the evening progressed, Nina couldn't help but notice the way Des's attention shifted more and more towards Lara. He complimented her dress, laughed a little too heartily at her jokes, and leaned in a bit closer than necessary. Lara seemed to enjoy the attention, her laughter ringing out across the table.

Nina's relief turned into a knot of unease in her stomach. She forced a smile, trying to hide her discomfort. Des's charm, which had always made her feel special, now felt like a double-edged sword. She watched as he flirted with Lara, his compliments becoming more frequent, his gaze lingering a little too long.

"So, Lara," Des said, his voice smooth, "Nina never mentioned how stunning her sister is."

Lara blushed, glancing at Nina with a mix of embarrassment and amusement. "You're too kind, Des."

Nina's heart sank, and she looked away, fiddling with her glass. She had hoped for a connection between her sister and her boyfriend, but this was not what she had envisioned. She cleared her throat, trying to steer the conversation back to safer ground.

"Des, why don't you tell Lara about that trip we took to the coast last month?" she suggested, forcing enthusiasm into her voice.

Des turned his attention back to Nina, but the spark in his eyes seemed dimmed. "Sure, Nina," he said, before launching into the story.

Nina felt a confusing mix of emotions. She was glad Lara liked Des, but the way Des had flirted with her sister left her feeling unsettled. However, as the evening wore on Des complimented Nina and gave her more attention she relaxed, "he is just being friendly" she thought to herself.

At the end of the meal they had coffee and Nina relaxed and snuggled up to Des, Des put his arm around her. Lara gave her an encouraging smile.

After a bit Des suggested they go out on Saturday night to a club, Lara seemed okay with that and Nina agreed.

On Saturday morning while they were having breakfast Nina felt ever so mild cramps, on her right side, and her breasts were slightly more tender than normal. So mild she barely noticed and dismissed both symptoms without a thought but she was ovulating, an egg was waiting to be fertilised. And having been sisters living together for so long their periods had synchronised when they lived at home so Lara would start her ovulation soon as well.

Nina and Lara stood at the entrance of Bar Med, the neon lights casting vibrant hues onto their faces. Des, waiting outside, broke into a broad smile as he saw them approach. "Ladies, you made it!" he called out, stepping forward to greet them.

"Wouldn't miss it for the world," Nina replied with a grin, her arm linked with Lara's.

Des gave them both a quick hug. "Come on, let's get inside. I've got some friends I want you to meet."

The trio pushed through the doors, immediately enveloped by the pulsating rhythm of the music. The bass thumped through the floor, and the air was thick with the energy of the crowd. Des navigated them through the throng, leading them to a corner where two men stood.

"Lara, this is Marcus," Des shouted over the music, gesturing to a tall, lean man with a friendly smile. "And this is Jamal," he added, pointing to a guy with a confident stance and an easy charm. He wore a tight-fitting t-shirt which showed off his Abs and loose sports trousers. His hair was braided and Lara was intrigued by the single diamond stud earring. He was like no one she had ever met.

"Nice to meet you," Lara said, offering a handshake that Jamal took with a playful grin. Marcus grinned at Nina and gave her a hug, Nina looked embarrassed previously having had sex with him, Des and two other men. She knew she would die if her sister found out.

"Would you like to dance?" Jamal asked Lara, his voice loud enough to cut through the music but smooth enough to convey his interest.

Lara glanced at Nina, who nodded encouragingly. "Sure," Lara replied, feeling a thrill of excitement as Jamal led her onto the dance floor.

As they disappeared into the sea of bodies, Des turned to Nina. "How about a drink?" he suggested, leading her to the bar. The bar was crowded, but Des found a spot where they could stand close together. As the bartender handed them their drinks, Des leaned in and kissed Nina passionately, catching her by surprise. She responded, lost in the moment, until they finally broke apart, both breathless and smiling.

"That was unexpected," Nina said, her eyes sparkling.

"Just couldn't help myself," Des replied with a wink.

Meanwhile, on the dance floor, Lara was having the time of her life. Jamal's moves were fluid and confident, and she matched his energy, feeling the music surge through her. She hadn't danced like this in ages, and the thrill of it was exhilarating. She laughed, twirled, and let the music take over, her worries melting away in the heat of the moment.

After what felt like an eternity, but was really only a few songs, Jamal led her back to the bar. She spotted Des and Nina, who were clearly enjoying each other's company. Although Lara did not notice, Des's hands were all over her buttocks. She did notice them kissing passionately and was a little bit jealous, she was intensely curious about dating and her own suppressed sexuality. Dancing with this buff older powerful black man had made her feel very aroused in a way she had never felt before.

"Having fun?" Nina asked as Lara approached, a knowing smile on her face.

"A blast," Lara replied, taking the drink that Des handed her. She took a sip, feeling the cool liquid soothe her parched throat. "Thanks for inviting us, Des. This is fun."

"I'm glad you're having a good time," Des said, his arm still around Nina's waist. "The night's just getting started."

They danced some more and each time they came back, there were more drinks waiting for them, sweet cocktails which masked a powerful kick. The club was hot and the drinks were refreshing but strong. The effects were soon telling on both girls but especially Lara, who never drank much.

Des had led Nina off to have some time along with her, Lara was dancing with Jamal when she felt a wave of dizziness and lightheadedness wash over her. "I think I need some fresh air," she said, her voice slightly slurred. Jamal, grabbed Marcus and whispered in his ear. Jamal took his bag and ever attentive, guided her out of the club, his hand resting gently on her back as they weaved through the crowd. Outside, the cool night air was a welcome relief, and she started to feel better. Jamal, ever the charmer, swung her lightly to the residual music thumping from inside the club and she giggled, not noticing his erection caused by their close physical contact.

Lara giggled, her head spinning with a mix of the alcohol and the exhilaration of the night. Without warning, Jamal kissed her firmly. The shock of it, left her momentarily stunned, but she quickly melted into the kiss, her heart racing with excitement. "Wow, this feels amazing," she thought.

"That was... unexpected," she whispered when they broke apart, her breath coming in quick, shallow gasps.

Jamal smiled, his eyes twinkling mischievously. "Just felt right," he said, his voice smooth and reassuring. They stood there for a moment, basking in the cool air and the lingering thrill of the kiss. Lara wanted more but Jamal knew to play this one cool, almost nonchalantly, Jamal pulled out a vape taking a slow drag before offering it to her.

Lara hesitated. "I don't know..."

"Just one puff," Jamal coaxed gently, his eyes meeting hers with a disarming intensity. "It'll help you relax."

Lara still hesitated, "I don't smoke," she said.

Jamal looked at her, directly in the eyes, "It's a vape, girl, besides one puff won't make you a smoker, it don't do you any harm, and you will enjoy the evening much more, just try."

Against her better judgment but not wanting to spoil the mood, Lara took the vape and inhaled. The smoke vapour was fruity and mellow and Jamal's steady gaze encouraged her. What she didn't know was that the vape was laced with a potent mix of synthetic cannabinoid and amphetamine compounds. A mix which would impair her judgement and lower her inhibitions, and it would also increase her libido.

The effects hit her almost immediately. A rush of euphoria surged through her, amplifying her senses to an almost overwhelming degree. The lights from the club, the distant hum of the city, even the feel of the pavement beneath her feet -- everything seemed more vivid, more alive. Her heart raced even faster, not just from the kiss but from the intoxicating mix now coursing through her system.

An intense warmth spread through her body, a heightened sense of pleasure that made her feel almost invincible. She felt an uncontrollable desire, an aphrodisiac effect that left her breathless and eager. The world around her seemed to pulse with electric energy, and she found herself leaning closer to Jamal, her last inhibitions rapidly dissolving, while her repressed sexualities exploded in her.

"See? Not so bad," Jamal murmured, his hand resting lightly on her hip. The touch sent shivers down her spine, and she bit her lip, trying to steady herself.

Lara's mind was a whirlwind of sensations -- excitement, fear, desire, and a strange, exhilarating sense of freedom. She clung to Jamal, her thoughts a chaotic mix of fragmented images and heightened emotions. He kissed her again and gently caressed her back. Because of everything which had happened Lara was in a highly suggestible state, her repressed desires bubbling up inside her like a volcano.

Marcus pulled up beside them in a black Ford Focus windows down and music blasting, Jamal led her to the car, opened the rear door and helped her get in. "We're just going to take you home Lara". Jamal said as he climbed into the seat next to her. She did not think to question any of this.

Lara snuggled up next to Jamal, craving his physical touch. Jamal craned his neck and kissed her, and she kissed him passionately back, wanting to feel him, her suppressed lust bubbling up inside her. Jamal ran his hands through her hair and down her body massageing her breasts through her dress, causing Lara to panted softly.

Jamal moved his hand to Lara's legs, he pulled up her dress, exposing her stark white legs, up to her panties. Lara was speechless with arousal. He pulled down her prim white panties, Lara lifted her bum into the air to let him and Jamal slid his index and middle finger between her legs and started rubbing her already well-lubricated clitoris and vulva. She gasped and her eyes widened in surprise, but she closed her eyes and gripped Jamal tightly as they kissed and he carried on playing with her, stroking the soft, wet lips of her vagina.

Lara was in ecstasy and she opened up her legs to get him to touch her deeper, and she started making little mewing sounds. Marcus listened to her, getting hard and trying to keep focused on the road.

They soon arrived at Des's house, Lara only aware they had arrived when the music stopped and Marcus switched the engine off and eagerly climbed out of the car, Jamal opened the door and got out, Lara pulled up her knickers, her heart thumping and she felt as nervous as a kitten, Jamal motioned for her to come out of the car, she took his hand and stepped out and immediately snuggled up to Jamal.

"C'mon babe" Jamal said as he took her hand and led her to the house.

Marcus had a set of keys and went ahead to open the door for them both. Once inside Jamal guided Lara into the living room, where the lights were set to low. Lara did not know it but her sister had been stripped in this room a few months ago.

Once in the room, he turned to face her, she gazed into his eyes, her heart thumping and her body trembling in anticipation. Marcus closed the door, even to Lara's addled brain this seemed odd somehow, but before she could think about this Jamal took her hand and pulled her into an embrace, she eagerly sank into his arms and kissed him.

Marcus put on some soft rap music with a mesmerising beat and joined the two lovers, he caressed Lara's hips before moving his hands up her back to the zip in the back of her dress. He pulled the zip slowly down exposing her pale back. He then lowered his arms to grip her dress and smoothly pulled the dress up, lifting it up her pale body and exposing her slim legs and perfect midriff. Lara was trembling in anticipation and did nothing to resist.

Without saying anything Jamal lifted up her arms so that Marcus could pull the dress over her head, before he rolled it up and threw it onto an easy chair next to them. Lara was semi-naked, in just her white trainers, knickers and bra, her slim white body sandwiched between two black bulls.

Lara was suddenly aware of her nakedness, although she was deeply aroused and very excited. The men's hands over her semi-naked body were intoxicating and then she felt the clasp on her bra being undone, the tension released as it unclasped and she felt the straps being slid over her shoulder. She offered no resistance and Jamal grinned as her small breasts were exposed, her nipples were hard nubs. He stroked them tenderly causing releases of oxytocin in her brain, the love hormone, it made her feel safe, relaxed and in love. Lara thought her legs would buckle.

Even though aroused this was going too fast for Lara and she crossed her hands across her breasts to protect her modesty, behind her Marcus simply hooked his thumbs in her her panties and firmly pulled them down. Too slow Lara crossed her legs to try and stop them coming down, but the panties were below her knees before she could, she felt Marcus lifting her ankles to remove her shoes and socks. In shock, she let him.

Jamal meanwhile put his arms around her and kissed her again, she melted in his embrace and slowly her arms loosened from protecting her breasts, she closed her eyes and embraced him.

With one hand Jamal pulled down his trousers and boxers, and his erect penis sprang out, he took Lara's hands and guided them down to his penis, she stopped kissing him to look at his penis, although training to be a vet she had yet to see a real one. Her heart was in her mouth. "Oh wow" was all she could say.

It was thicker than she imagined and she wondered what it would feel like inside her, in fact, she wonder if it would fit inside her. Unseen behind her Marcus had stripped off and now rubbed his meaty penis against her buttocks, but she barely noticed as Jamal was showing her how to hold and rub his penis. He kissed her again and moved his penis between her legs and rubbed it against her vulva, wetting it against the juices from her.

Lara was both scared and aroused, she knew she should be more scared but knew that she had gone too far, her heart raced and her mouth was dry, she gave into the situation and her repressed desires, she said plaintively "Please be gentle, I'm a virgin"

This got both the men's attention. "Say what?" Jamal said.

"I'm a virgin" Lara repeated in a quiet voice, "is that okay?"

The men chuckled and slapped hands, "Hell yeah" Jamal said, "but don't worry we will take real good care of you". He stroked her hair and then took her arms gently but firmly and held them behind her.

To distract her Jamal kissed her while Marcus went to a cupboard and took out a clear plastic mask with a flexible tube leading to a blackened glass bowl, he took a lighter and lit it playing the flame under the glass bowl until it and the pipe filled with white smoke. He came up behind Lara holding the mask. Jamal had her hands behind her back gripping them firmly, making Lara feel weak and helpless. He pulled away from the kiss, Lara leaned forward, eyes closed smiling, wanting more.

Marcus swiftly clammed the mask over her mouth, Lara gasped in surprise, sucking in the smoke, her eyes opened wide in alarm at first, and she tried to struggle but her head swam, and she started to relax. Lara instinctively tried to hold her breath, seeing this Jamal pressed his fingers into her vulva, causing her to gasp and inhale more. She felt high and she relaxed further as the drugs took effect.

Jamal released the grip on her hands and led her to the sofa, Lara was passive and submissive. Jamal positioned her sitting on the edge of the sofa, her slim bum on the seat's edge and her legs splayed out. Jamal sat next to her and started kissing her, pressing her back into the sofa.

Marcus kneeled in front of her and moved forward between her legs until his tongue touched her clitoris and with thick wet licks he worked up and down her vulva licked before gently sucking on her clitoris.

Lara was confused, she had expected just Jamal this sexy black man, but there were two men, but it felt so good, and she did not know what to say. Her nipples hardened and she let out mews of pleasure as she kissed Jamal passionately. The drugs had suppressed her inhibitions, she felt amazingly, sexy and desperately desired to lose her virginity to this strong older man.

Lara was in heaven, she moaned with pleasure, one arm gripped Jamal, and the other was holding onto the back of Marcus's head, pressing him onto her virgin and once private areas, she had never felt this good.

Tension built up inside her, she stretched her legs out and just as she thought she could not take any more, the tension released and she mewed like a kitten as the orgasm shot through her. She lay there panting, Marcus, Lara's legs still resting on his shoulders, lifted his head to look at her, a proud look on his face.

Through prior agreement, Jamal got up and Marcus knelt down on the sofa next to Lara. His erect penis was close to Lara's face. Lara still had her eyes closed recovering from her first ever proper orgasm. She felt something fleshy touch her lips, she opened her eyes to see Marcus looming over her, she realised with a jolt that it was his penis pressing against her lips.

In front of her, Jamal had now stripped as well and had gripped her knees gently pulling her legs apart to make room for his dark naked torso between her legs.

Lara had never sucked on a penis before and had never thought about doing it herself, when it had been described in school it had been a gross thought. In her drug-addled state, she struggled to comprehend what was happening. But as Jamal reached her with his long thick penis, and touched her engorged pussy, she involuntarily gasped and Marus took the opportunity to push his penis inside her mouth,

Jamal used his fingers to spread her vagina lips, he looked to see her intact hymen, "no shit she is a virgin" he said surprised. He let go and positioned his penis against the lips of her vagina, he took out some lube and applied it to his penis, before shutting the tube and dropping it on the floor.

Lara realised what was about to happen, she knew she was about to have her virginity taken, and her heart thumped, she started to protest, but she felt Jamal's thick penis enter her, penetrating just a short way, and her words died in her throat. Jamal made short gentle thrusts lubricating her vagina which softened and lubricated more. Suddenly she wanted him inside her, she wanted to feel his thickness penetrate her, she wanted to be blacked. She was too excited to think of protection.

"Take me" she gasped Marcus having removed his penis from her mouth as she was not doing a good job of the blow job.

Jamal did not need to be asked twice, he pressed harder, Lara's virgin pussy felt tight, so he made gentle thrusts, each time going a little deeper. Lara expected there to be pain, but she was both extremely aroused and relaxed from the drugs, and she was shocked by how good it felt.

Pressing up against Lara's intact hymen, Lara felt a glorious tension building inside her, she cried out as the soft tissue of her hymen gave way and all of a sudden Jamal's penis slid several centimetres inside her with no resistance. The small discomfort Lara felt was replaced by waves of pleasure as Jamal started slow long thrusts pushing further inside her. Lara was panting now, and moaning, her eyes were closed and she forgot all about Marcus as she revelled in the feeling of being taken, not once did she worry that this man was about to ejaculate inside her. Jamal's penis was thick and it filled her up giving her the most amazing stimulation which nothing could have prepared her for.

Lara felt enormous tension building inside her, instinctively she gripped Jamal's penis harder with the muscles in her vagina, hormones flooded her brain, making her feel in love with Jamal, her inhibitions removed she cried out telling him so as her body orgasmed.

Jamal came shortly after, he jerked repeatably as his semen was released inside her. He stopped his penis still inside her, before slowly pulling out, causing Lara to shudder. She turned around and stood up to kiss Jamal, semen dripping from her vagina and small droplets running down her leg, feeling cold against her hot body.

Marcus was waiting impatiently and Jamal sat Lara down on the sofa distracting her by kissing her as Marcus spread her legs and mounted her. Lara did not know what was happening until she felt Marcus's penis touching her vagina, a second later it was too late and Marcus was thrusting inside her and grunting. Jamal moved away and Lara looked up to see Marcus towering above her, she turned to look at Jamal who was watching them, he smiled at her and she smiled back before a hard thrust from Marcus made her gasp, Marcus was eager and was not inclined to be gentle now.

Back at the club Nina and Des moved closer to the bar, the dim lights casting a warm glow over their faces. The music pulsed around them, but Nina's mind was elsewhere. She scanned the crowded club, her brows furrowed with concern.

"Have you seen Lara?" she asked, her voice barely audible over the thumping bass.

Des shook his head. "She was with Jamal last I saw. Maybe they're still dancing?"

Nina bit her lip, worry gnawing at her. "I can't see her anywhere. I'm getting really worried, Des."

Des took her hand reassuringly. "Let's look for them. They can't have gone far."

Together, they weaved through the crowd, searching every corner of the club. They checked the dance floor, the lounge areas, and even the bathrooms, but there was no sign of Lara or Jamal. Nina's anxiety grew with every passing minute.

Just then, Des's phone buzzed with a text message. He glanced at the screen, then turned to Nina, his expression serious. "It's from Jamal. He says they've gone to my house. Lara needed a rest"

Nina's eyes widened with a mix of relief and residual worry. "We need to go there, now. I have to make sure she's okay."

Des nodded, his face mirroring her concern. "Let's go. I'll get us a cab."

They hurried outside the cool night air a stark contrast to the heat of the club. Des quickly hailed a taxi, and they slid into the back seat. As the car sped through the city streets, Nina's mind raced with a thousand thoughts.

"She's probably fine," Des said, trying to comfort her. "Jamal's a good guy. He wouldn't let anything happen to her."

Nina nodded, but her heart wouldn't stop pounding. "I just need to see her."

Des and Nina arrived back and unlocked the door and entered the house, Nina heard noises coming from the living room which made her instantly worried, ignoring Des calling her, she reached the living room door and pushed it open.

Lara was on the sofa, one naked leg lay on top of the back of the sofa the other one was stretched out to the floor, in between was the naked black buttocks of Marcus, her slim white legs in stark contrast to the dark grey sofa and the dark chocolate brown of Marcus. He was rutting her and from the expression on her face, Lara was enjoying it. Nina did not even notice Jamal, naked and gently pulling on his erection as he watched them.

Lara was still high from the drugs, her inhibitions temporally suppressed, she cried out in ecstasy as she approached her fourth orgasm.

Nina was shocked, she knew Lara was a virgin and not on the pill. She also knew these men did not use condoms, she was her little sister. Des took her hand and led her away to the kitchen.

Nina sat on a chair in the kitchen, her hands clasped tightly in her lap. Her eyes were wide, a mix of shock and disbelief clouding her usually composed features. Des stood in front of her, his expression calm but tinged with concern as he watched her struggle to process what she had just seen.

"She...," Nina said, her voice trembling slightly. "Lara... she's only eighteen. I can't believe she... I can't believe she's lost her virginity."

Des exhaled softly, sitting down beside her. He placed a gentle hand on her shoulder, trying to offer comfort. "Nina, I know it's a lot to take in, but you need to breathe. This isn't the end of the world."

Nina turned to him, her brow furrowed. "But she's so young, Des. She's my little sister. I was supposed to protect her, to make sure she didn't make any mistakes she'd regret."

He nodded, understanding the weight of her words. "I get that, I do. But she's growing up, Nina. She's going to make her own choices, whether we like them or not."

Nina shook her head, still grappling with the reality of it all. "I just... I don't want her to get hurt."

Des moved closer, his hand sliding down to hold hers. "Lara's strong, Nina. She's not a little girl anymore, and from what you've told me, it sounds like she made her decision carefully. She wasn't pressured into anything, it was right for us."

Nina bit her lip, her eyes flickering with uncertainty, worse than seeing her sister being rutted was the guilt and alarm of how arousing Nina found it. "But what if she regrets it? What if she wasn't ready?"

"That's something only she can decide," Des replied gently. "But from what you said, it doesn't sound like she regrets it. She came to you because she trusts you, because she knows you'll understand, even if you're shocked right now."

Nina's gaze softened as she considered his words. She knew he was right, but it didn't make it any easier to accept. "I just wish I could have been there for her, to talk her through it."

Des squeezed her hand. "You're still here for her, Nina. She needs you now more than ever--to listen, to support her. She's not asking you to fix anything, just to be her sister."

Nina let out a slow breath, her shoulders relaxing just a little. "I suppose you're right. I just want to make sure she's okay."

"And you will," Des said, his voice steady. "Lara's lucky to have you. You'll guide her through this like you always have."

Nina nodded, feeling some of the tension begin to ease. "I just never expected this, not so soon."

Des smiled softly, brushing a stray lock of hair from her face. "Life has a way of throwing surprises at us. But you've got this, Nina. And so does Lara."

She looked up at him, a faint smile finally breaking through her worry. "Thank you, Des. For always being here."

"Always," he promised, leaning in to press a reassuring kiss. It started as a gentle kiss but Nina needed more, she pressed herself against his body.

During ovulation Nina's sexual hormones increased and with it her sex drive, somehow seeing her sister being ravished had been exciting for her as well, her desire for Des grew.

Des got the message, he took her hand and led her upstairs to his room, where he stripped her naked before undressing himself, and she sat on the edge of the bed, naked transfixed by his firm body. She was trembling with anticipation. Des approached her his penis fully erect and gently pushed her back onto the bed and moved between her legs, Nina, resting on her elbows kissed him, her gasps turned to moans as he rubbed his penis against her clitoris, their desire for each other made foreplay superfluous and Des was soon inside her, his naked penis thrusting insider her as Nina wrapped her legs around his firm black buttocks.

Des felt the climax building, the secret knowledge that this may impregnate Nina was an extra thrill, he thrust harder to get his sperm as far up her vagina as possible. Nina's vaginal muscles spasmed as she orgasmed gripping Des's penis and sending him over the edge. He had not ejeculated in a week and he had plenty stored up. He came.

A couple of hours later, with Nina safely asleep, Des left the bed and went into the bedroom next door, Jamal and Lara were asleep in the bed, Des lifted the covers and climbed in next to Lara. Exhausted Lara had been led upstairs earlier leaving her clothes in the living room and put to bed snuggled up next to Jamal, naked.

Des wanted Nina's sister and he found her vulnerability intoxicating. His fingers started to rub her clitoris, Lara sleepily tried to swat his hand away and moaned half asleep, Des stifled this with a kiss, he pressed harder against her clitoris which started to lubricate. Lara had been having a sexual dream and woke to find that dream coming true. After the initial shock, she kissed back thinking it was Jamal and opened her legs to give Des better access for his fingers to stroke her vulva.

Des was already naked and swiftly mounted her, her vagina was slick with her own juices and the semen that both Jamal and Marcus had ejaculated into her. She moaned as Des entered her, waking Jamal who rolled over and promptly went to sleep again.

The thought of taking both sisters excited Des and soon he added his semen to Lara's vagina. He rolled off her, she snuggled up to him, exhausted and she fell asleep, Des disentangled himself and crept back to his room.

The next morning Wayne arrived at the house in the morning, everyone was still asleep, he put the TV on and made himself a mug of coffee.

Around 10:30 Lara awoke, next to her was Jamal naked and sleeping. She could remember last night, though she was not sure who had taken her for the third time, she assumed Jamal and what had happened, she could feel her vagina slick with semen, she rose and tried to find her clothes. This woke Jamal who smiled at her, "Morning Gorgeous" he said motioning for her to come to him.

Lara blushed and came to him, "Hi" she said. Jamal took her wrist and pulled her down so he could kiss her. Lara's heart raced. Eventually, she broke off, "Where is the bathroom, I need to pee" she said plaintively.

Still naked they crept out of the bedroom and Jamal showed her where the toilet was. Jamal waited for her outside.

Lara came out of the bathroom with a bath towel wrapped around her, Jamal grinned and took her by the hand back to the bedroom. He kissed her and undid the towel, unresisting Lara let it drop to the floor. She squealed as Jamal pushed her back onto the bed, before climbing on top of her, he kissed her as his erect penis touched her. This time she bit her lip gently as she smiled and opened her legs. She knew she was not on the pill but she figured it was too late to worry about that now and she wanted more of him.

Attracted by the noise and driven by the smell of sex which pervaded the house, the smell of young woman's eager excitement, their sexual fluids mixed with older black men's cum. Wayne went upstairs to investigate, without knocking he went into the room where he could hear the sensual moans of Lara as Jamal penetrated her.

Despite Lara being in the throws of passion, she noticed him as he came into the bedroom and watched wide-eyed as he started to strip his clothes off. She knew she had been taken by two men last night (she thought Des in the middle of the night had been Jamal) and thought this man must be Marcus again. She stopped watching Wayne as she started to climax, her body arched and she closed her eyes to focus on the wonderful feeling was building between her legs.

Jamal finished shortly after, ejaculating more sperm into her vagina, he rolled off her and greeted Wayne who got onto the bed and lay down. He grinned at Lara as he started to stroke his erect penis. Lara eyed him warily.

"We are going to teach you to suck a man's dick, Lara. It is an important skill. You want to please your man don't you Lara?" Jamal said. Lara nodded dumbly.

Jamal started to instruct her, "Okay Lara, you go ahead and get above my brother's dick now", without a word Lara did as she was told, leaning over to reach his magnificent erection.

"Okay girl, gently stroke his big black dick with your hand", resting on one hand she used the other one to stroke Wayne's penis.

Lara looked up as she took Wayne's penis, making eye contact, Wayne smiled encouragingly at her.

"Now keep stoking but put his dick in your mouth, that's right, suck a bit, lick the head of this dick... that good Wayne? Wayne grunted positively.

Lara was surprised to find she was enjoying this. The penis did not taste gross, slightly saltly but she liked being so desired by both men.

She felt Jamal playing with her buttocks. She liked that as well. Suddenly she felt something cold and gel-like around her buttocks. Then a cold hard thing pressed against her anus, and she squealed in surprise. But the sensation was not unpleasant, sort of giving her a full feeling. She concentrated on sucking Wayne's penis.

Next, she felt Jamal's fingers between her legs, she opened them to let him have better access as he stroked her clitoris. It felt great and she was enjoying this when Jamal stopped, she felt movement behind her but could not turn as Wayne had his hand on her head.

Her heart fluttered when she felt Jamal's penis press against her vulva, he fiddled with his penis lining it up before Lara felt gentle but growing pressure on her tight vagina, the pressure eased as she felt his penis enter her and she murmured in appreciation of the amazing feeling of Jamal's long and thick black penis inside her, there was no pain now just joy and she closed her eyes enjoying this new sensation of being taken from behind.

Wayne let go of her head and wiggled further down. He massaged her breasts as Jamal ruthlessly pounded her from behind. Wayne kissed her and she kissed him back until the sexual tension built and her panting became unbridled cries of passion. Her orgasm came like a wave crashing over her.

Wayne was already under her, Jamal helped the overwhelmed Lara to an upright position and Wayne positioned his penis underneath her, Lara was still coming down from the high and was shocked to feel another penis breaching her, her legs gave way and she sat down, impaled on Wayne's erection. She had placed her hands on his chest and her eyes focussed to see Wayne's grinning face.

His penis felt good inside her, she wiggled experimentally, it felt very good. The object in her bum and Wayne's penis inside her filled her up delightfully. She did not recognise Wayne but thought it must be the other man from last night. It crossed her him to ask his name but she dismissed the notion as too embarrassing.

Instinctively she leaned forward and gyrated her hips. Her tight vagina gripped his naked penis. He bounced up and down until Wayne instructed her to stop. Still, inside her, he rolled her onto her back and started to pound her. Lara was so aroused she quickly orgasmed, but Wayne kept pounding her, not giving her any respite, she lifted her legs up which improved the feeling and she forgot everything other than the growing orgasm, she started to gasp and moan.

In the next bedroom, Nina woke up to the noise of her sister orgasming and the rhythmic sound of the bed. Des stirred next to her, she tried to block the image out of her baby sister and focus on Des, she smiled at him and he snuggled next to her.

"Don't look so worried, she is just having fun" Des said in a low voice.

Nina smiled back, "she is my little sister, somehow I never expected this". Des started to stroke her, down the length of her body.

"Look babe, she is an adult now, she can make her own decision. She clearly had cravings"

His hand was on her inner thigh now, Nina bit her lip willing herself to stop thinking of her sister being taken by Marcus. Des kissed her, she resisted for a moment and then surrendered, her arousal getting the better of her, she opened up her legs so that Des could finger her but try as she might she could not get the image of Marcus out of her mind.

After a couple of minutes, Des sat up and opened the draw next to him, he took out a curved pink vibrator with a bulbous head, and switched it on, the familiar buzz making Nina tremble in anticipation and placed it against Nina's clitoris before leaning over to kiss her, Nina placed her hand on his to guide him. They kissed passionately as the vibrator gave Nina the first orgasm of the morning and got her ready to receive Des's thick penis.

The truth was Nina loved Des's semen, she fantasised about him cumming inside her, his seed filling her up. She was not aware of the fact that semen is full of male hormones which are easily absorbed by the thin tissue in her vagina into her bloodstream. These hormones would change her mood, boosting her happy hormones. The week with her sister where she had not had sex with Des had left her craving both Des and semen.

This time however was a little different, Nina had fallen asleep in Des's arms last night, satisfied and exhausted and had not showered, her vagina still containing Des's sperm. While lying in bed asleep last night, tens of thousands of Des's sperm had wiggled their way up her cervix and to her egg, now in the morning one had penetrated it. Though she did not yet know it she was pregnant. Her younger sister was impregnated multiple times last night, and she would be pregnant shortly as well.

Meanwhile, Marcus had got up in a cheerful mood having slept on the sofa bed downstairs with Lara's knickers on the pillow. He now wanted the other sister. He showered and brushed his teeth.

With minty breath, he went to Des's room to catch sight of Nina's legs in the air with Des's backside between them. Marcus knew because Des had told him that Nina was off the pill and likely ovulating. That suited Marcus just fine.

Nina had just cum, and was panting a little, she still could not shake the image of Marcus from her mind and had been fantasying about him while making love to Des. Now he was here in front of her, wearing nothing but a grin, a healthy erection jutting proudly out.

Des exhausted for the moment rolled off Nina as Marcus sat on the bed next to Nina, confident and naked, his penis jutting proudly above his muscular legs. Des drew back the duvet to expose her naked body to his friend.

Nina knew what both men wanted and this time she smiled at Marcus, she had climaxed twice and was very aroused still, her vagina wet and sensitive, she reached over and started to stroke Marcus's erection, Des started to kiss her neck, and she moved her head so they could kiss. Marcus had enough of the foreplay, stood up and kneeled on the bed, climbing over her legs before mounting her. Nina helped guide his erect penis inside her, her aroused and well-lubricated vagina welcoming. As Marcus entered her she lay back closed her eyes and pictured her sister receiving similar treatment in the bedroom next door.

Next Marcus pinned her wrists with one hand above her head as he pressed his large stiff penis against the lips of her vagina which opened to let him penetrate inside her. Nina's vagina was slick with Des's semen. Nina closed her eyes as Marcus started thrusting. The feeling was overwhelming and she could not help but gasp and moan just like her sister had.

Des lay next to Nina watching Marcus on top of Nina, his girlfriend, her eyes closed, head arched back in ecstasy, panting in time with Marcus's thrusts. Des picked up his phone to film.

Des and Nina, came down to the kitchen, leaving Marcus asleep in their bed, Nina dressed in Des's t-shirt. Des made coffee for them both and they sipped in silence.

Lara came down with Jamal, he had his arm around her and she snuggled next to him. Neither sister attempted eye contact both feeling embarrassed. The men grinned at this.

Sensing the awkwardness Des spoke up "C'mon Nina let's get some Breakfast" and led her out of the kitchen.

Des drove them down to a cafe in the centre of town, where they ordered coffee and breakfast. Nina had been silent in the car, lost in thought.

Nina stared into her cup, the steam swirling lazily upwards, but her mind was too full for her to enjoy the moment. Des had brought her to the café after seeing how upset she was, but the warm lights and gentle chatter around them did little to soothe her nerves.

"You're still thinking about it, aren't you?" Des's voice was soft, but Nina could hear the concern beneath it.

She didn't answer at first, just wrapped her hands around the cup like it was the only thing grounding her. Finally, she nodded. "I can't stop thinking about it."

Des sighed, leaning back in his chair. "It's about Lara and Jamal."

Nina's lips pressed into a thin line. She hated how well he knew her, how he could read every flicker of worry. "I don't know what to do, Des. She's... she's so young, and he's--"

"Older. I know."

Nina shook her head, her frustration spilling over. "It's not just that. It's *him*. He's experienced. He knows exactly how to say the right things, how to make her feel like she's special like it's all real. But it's not."

Des watched her, letting her words settle before speaking. "You think he's manipulating her."

"I *know* he is," she snapped, then softened, glancing down at her lap. "Lara's always been so... trusting. She doesn't see the world the way it really is. And Jamal--he's not some harmless crush. He's much older, Des. What's a man his age doing with someone like her?"

Des reached across the table, resting his hand gently on hers. "I get it. You're worried. She's your sister, and you've always looked out for her." Inwardly he thought about the age gap between Nina and himself.

Nina pulled her hand away, running it through her hair. "I can't stop thinking about them alone in the house together. Every time I leave, I'm scared she's getting in too deep. I'm scared she's going to lose herself to him."

"Do you think Lara's happy?" Des asked carefully, his eyes never leaving her face.

"That's the worst part," Nina muttered, her voice tight with emotion. "She's *too* happy. She acts like everything's perfect. Like she's in this bubble, and I'm standing outside watching her walk blindly into something terrible."

Des nodded slowly. "You think she's in over her head."

"She *is* in over her head! She's nineteen, Des. She's never had a serious relationship before, and now this... this man comes along, making her feel like she's living some kind of fairy tale." Nina's voice cracked, and she bit her lip, trying to hold back the surge of emotions. "I just don't want her to get hurt."

Des was quiet for a moment, letting the silence linger between them. "You can't protect her from everything, Nina."

"But I should be able to protect her from *this*," she whispered fiercely. "I'm her big sister. I'm supposed to know better. And I don't trust him, Des. I don't trust him at all."

Des leaned forward, his voice calm but firm. "I know you don't. And maybe you're right. Maybe Jamal's not what he seems. But Lara... she has to figure that out for herself. You can't keep her from making mistakes."

Nina closed her eyes, her chest tightening. "But what if this isn't just a mistake? What if it's something worse? What if she wakes up one day, and it's too late?"

Des reached out again, taking her hand. "Then you'll be there for her. You can't stop her from falling, Nina. But you can be there when she does."

Tears pricked the corners of Nina's eyes, but she blinked them away. "I just... I don't want to see her broken, Des."

"You won't," Des said softly. "Because she has you. And you're stronger than you know."

Des discreetly passed Nina a packet, she glanced at it. The Morning After pill. Without a word, she slipped it into her pocket. Des grinned, he knew where that had come from. He wondered if Nina was pregnant. With Lara sleeping with Jamal there was no reason he couldn't resume sleepovers with Nina. Or let his friends have her. They left for home.

Jamal dropped Lara off that evening. Nina watched them from her window. Lara looking so happy. However that happiness seemed to have evaporated by the time Jamal had left and Lara reached the door to Nina's house.

Nina opened the door and just gave Lara a hug, it was what Lara needed.

Warning

This story covers some dark areas, involving individuals who are not very nice. Unlike the previous stories, this does involve rape. You may wish to avoid reading if offended by such topics.

---

Nina was pregnant, she was not aware yet, but inside her womb, Des's baby was growing. Back at University now, Lara was also pregnant and in love with Jamal. Perhaps not in love, which is a strong word, but if not she was utterly besotted.

Neither girl had been experiencing morning sickness yet, which would not come for a few weeks. They were both a week into their pregnancies, and since they would not be expecting a period for another three weeks both were blissfully unaware they were growing new black babies in their wombs. That said changes were happening to them, both had wondered if their breasts had grown and Nina especially was feeling the effects of the hormones, her libido had increased significantly.

Lara had remained the rest of the week, splitting her time between Nina's home and spending time with Jamal. Both sisters studiously avoided discussing what had happened, both embarrassed about what had happened and what they had witnessed.

Des was in a bind. He owed money to Mr Adebayo, and Mr Adebayo was not a nice individual. Originally from Nigeria, he had emigrated to the UK over two decades ago, he had never lost his strong Nigerian accent nor his links to the Nigerian criminal underworld. He lived in a large house in South London, among other interests he was involved in loan sharking, and running a number of girls. At 56 he was still sharp and fit, he needed to match his ruthlessness with cunning and strength. His dense woolly hair was turning to white and he had to dye it now, His skin was a dark brown almost black, he had the magmatism of a powerful man.

Mr Adebayo drove a BMW M series, he liked the feel of the power under the bonnet, even if it did garner too much attention from the police, who did not have him on their radar, just merely saw a black man in an expensive car and that was enough to pull him over. Mr Adebayo was smart enough not to protest, not to get noticed, though he seethed with rage underneath.

He dressed smartly, in an expensive shirt and suit and a big fat gold Rolex, a real one, which had cost him nearly £15,000. Among other assets, he had a letting agency which was a convenient front for him to launder money from his other activities. He mainly dealt with houses of multiple occupancy, the landlords being in a different name and often "abroad". He dealt in cash and rarely was a tenant ever late with their rent, at least not more than once.

Mr Adebayo outsourced most of his work to one of a number of gangs he worked with, he had his own staff and employed Chidiebere "Chidy" as his number two. Chidy was street-wise and ambitious, raised in the slums in Lagos, he had been spotted by a friend of Mr Adebayo, who after a short period of working for him in Nigeria had been sponsored to attend a college in London. He never went and the college took the money and gave him the required certificate.

Chidy had a hard upbringing, his father had battered his mother to death after a particularly hard-drinking session. Growing up being raised by his older brother and sister had taught him some hard lessons. As a man, he had not forgotten them and demanded respect. Those who did not immediately give it were in trouble, including one unfortunate out-of-towner who had offended Chidy in a club and paid for it with a knife through the heart, no one had seen anything of course.

Des would not normally have been involved with a man like Mr Adebayo, apart from anything else Des was Jamaican British and did not like the relentlessness of Nigerians, let alone wanting to owe money to the shark-like Mr Adebayo.

But Des has to help out a friend who invested a small amount of money in their business. As it turned out the business was a front for drugs which had been busted in its 2 months of operation. The hapless friend has the premises seized along with a considerable amount of drugs and money. Money which he had borrowed from Mr Adebayo, who now held Des liable for the debt.

While not rich, Des did well off his fitness and dance instruction, with his savings and his car he could cover nearly two-thirds of the debt, but the interest on even the third left would quickly put him back to square one. He needed more time to raise the funds without the interest building up. He knew there was not really any other choice not if he wanted to avoid a beating at first and to be in debt to Adebayo for the rest of his life, or at worst to have his throat slit as a warning to others.

His first payoff had been a girl called Ashley, a girl he knew through his dance class, it brough him another week. She had had an immediate crush on him when she met him at one of his classes and had been trying to flirt with him ever since, but he had not been that interested, she was too easy and had no class. She had been chatty and a half bored Des had her life story. Brought up in a bad home, has been taken into foster care, bounced around homes, and dabbled with drugs but was clean now, she had a job and wanted a life. She wanted the sort of adventure she read in cheap romantic novels. She would be easy meat for someone as ruthless as Chidy.

Des had texted her and invited her out she had been keen and they had exchanged some flirty messages, with Des being clear he wanted her to meet his friend. They arranged to meet the following evening, in Brixton, Adebayo's manor.

She was there when Des arrived, keen to see the object of her affections, as was Chidy who made brief eye contact with Des as he entered, a message not to cross him. Des took a seat next to Ashley, she had brightened up when she had seen him, She was 25, with shoulder-length brunette hair that had been streaked with blonde highlights in an effort to brighten her appearance. The highlights were slightly grown out, betraying a lack of upkeep, but she hoped the effect still looked intentional.

Her low self-esteem showed in the way she dressed: an effort to be alluring but not entirely believing she could pull it off. She wore a figure-hugging top that clung to her curves, its neckline just low enough to catch attention but not daring enough to make her feel fully exposed. She'd draped a cropped leather jacket over her shoulders, giving her outfit a veneer of edge she didn't quite feel.

Her makeup was heavier than usual, applied with care but betraying a trembling hand. Foundation smoothed her pale skin to a uniform finish, but the blush on her cheeks was too pronounced, an attempt to add vibrancy to her nervous complexion. Her eyeliner was slightly uneven, the flicks at the edges of her eyes tilted at slightly different angles, and her lipstick--a soft pink gloss--was already fading at the edges where she had anxiously chewed her lips.

She fidgeted with the strap of her small black handbag as she glanced around, her eyes flitting nervously but brightening whenever they landed on Des. Her movements were self-conscious, her hands repeatedly smoothing down her dress or adjusting her hair, as though she was trying to fix flaws no one else could see.

Des greeted her and then called Chidy over with as much bonhomie as he could summon and introductions were made. Chidy put on the charm which, made Des recoil, but worked on Ashley who simply wanted to be the centre of attention, she seemed to relax and was happy to accept drinks from the men. Chidy insisted he buy them and left for the bar.

Des felt guilty and awkward, and attempted small back, but was relieved when Chidy was back, he sipped his beer knowing the cost would be added to his debt. Ashley quickly finished hers and Chidy insisted on getting her another drink.

After the second drink, Ashley was slurring her words, and Des figured her drink had been tampered with. Chidy had her arm around her and was laying on the charm, she looked compliant and somewhat out of it. Des sensed he was no longer needed, he made an excuse and left. He felt sick afterwards, these men were animals. He was not surprised when Ashley did not turn up to the next class.

Now a week later, there was a hammering on the door, he recognised Chidy's voice angrily calling his name, and he hurried to open the door. Chidy's temper was famously short.

Des heard the knock before he saw the figure looming in his doorway. He hesitated, the weight of what was coming settling like a stone in his chest. When he opened the door, Chidy stood there, tall and imposing, his face calm but his eyes cold.

"Des, my man," Chidy said, stepping into the house uninvited. His voice, smooth but edged with steel, carried the sharpness of a threat not yet spoken. "You know why I'm here, don't you?"

Des closed the door behind him, his hands tightening into fists at his sides. "Yeah, I know," he muttered. "I told you last time, I'm working on it. I've already paid more than half. Just give me a little more time."

Chidy leaned against the wall, arms crossed over his broad chest. He tilted his head slightly, studying Des with the patience of a predator. "Time?" he repeated, his tone almost amused. "You think time is free? Time costs money, Des. And you still owe Mr. Adebayo. He doesn't like waiting."

Des shifted his weight, trying to hold his ground but feeling smaller with every word. "I'm doing what I can," he said, his voice tight. "Business has been slow lately, but I'll get the rest. I just need--"

Chidy pushed off the wall, closing the distance between them in a single step. "No more excuses," he said, his voice dropping into something cold and final. "Mr. Adebayo isn't a charity. You owe him his money. Now you're dragging your feet, and I'm the one who has to come here and remind you what happens when people don't pay."

Des bristled, his frustration bubbling over despite the danger standing in front of him. "I'm not trying to skip out!" he snapped, his voice rising. "I've given you everything I've got! Do you think this is easy for me?"

Chidy's lips curved into a faint smile, one that sent a chill down Des's spine. There was no warmth in it, just the barest flicker of amusement. "Easy?" Chidy said softly. "You think Mr. Adebayo cares if it's easy? What he cares about is his money. And if he doesn't get it..." He let the sentence trail off, his meaning clear without needing words.

Des swallowed hard, his throat dry. "I just need a little more time," he said again, his voice quieter now, almost pleading.

Chidy stepped even closer, his presence overwhelming. He reached out, placing a heavy hand on Des's shoulder. "Des," he said, his tone almost gentle, but the menace underneath it was unmistakable. "You know what happens to people who don't pay. Don't make me have to remind you. Find the money. Fast."

Des nodded stiffly, the weight of Chidy's hand a silent promise of what would come if he failed.

Chidy looked around the room, looking for valuables or pressure points. He found one. Nina had left a picture in a frame of herself, smiling in a long floral red dress. She was trying to inch her way into Des's life and bit by bit was leaving more and more things in Des's house, the framed photo was the latest, she had no idea the danger that had now put her in. Chidy's eyes fell on the photograph. She looked young, vivacious and innocent. Chidy examined the photo.

He jerked his head to indicate the photo, "Who this then?"

"No one" Des said instinctively "just some girl from a class". His voice had dropped an octave and Chidy's eyes narrowed as he watched Des's expression. His instincts told him that Des was lying.

"Let's talk about this no one" Chidy said.

It was the weekend before Des broached the subject. He told her about his friend, his business (omitting to mention the drugs), the money he owed to Mr Adebayo, and finally what would happen to him unless the debt was paid.

Nina was aghast "You must go to the police" she immediately.

"I do that and I am a dead man, there is no evidence but as soon as Adebayo found out I had talked he will get someone to go after me" Des replied. He looked glum.

"I will give you what I have and I can borrow money for you" Nina replied. They spent the rest of the afternoon trying loan applications but by the end of it Nina only had a quarter of the money needed. Nina was frightened now Des having explained the consequences of non-payment. In desperation, she called her parents to see if they would lend her the money. They promised they would look into it but by the end of the call they were suspicious and worried themselves.

More than money Des needed Nina to do something for him, she had to buy him more time, and the currency she had was her young slim body and beautiful face. But he could not force her. Instead, he manipulated her until she was coming up with ideas, wild crazy ideas born from desperation.

"What else is there" she asked eventually.

This was the point where Des knew he had to gamble, most likely she would storm out, and that would be that, but what choice did he have?

Des's phone rang right on cue. He knew who it was. He picked it up, an angry Chidy was on the other end. Des went through how much he had raised and when it would be paid.

Nina's hopes grew as the two men talked.

"Are you fucking with me man?" Chidy screamed down the line after Des had finihsed. "How fucking stupid do you think I am. That is pathetic, don't you know what will happen to you if you don't pay? You ask for more time and then you insult me like this? What the fuck? You will die, chopped up into fucking fish food".

Nina gasped as everything was clearly audible. Chidy went silent. The tension was agonising.

"Who that with you Des" Chidy's voice was dangerously calm

"No one, don't worry about it" Des said hastily.

The phone pinged, Chidy was requesting a video call. Des accepted

"Des who that fucking with you?" The screen was dark, with lights in the distance. Chidy was calling from a car and the darkness obscured the view of his face.

"It's just my girlfriend, she's not part of this man," Des said, putting an edge of desperation in his voice.

"The hell she is" Chidy replied "Let me talk to her".

Reluctantly Des handed over the phone to Nina. With trembling hands she took it.

"Please leave Des alone, we will get you your money, I promise," Nina said. She was used to a world of reasonable people, she was totally unprepared for the world that Chidy inhabited.

"We will leave him alone when the money is paid and if the money is not paid in cash it will need to be paid in blood" Chidy said angrily, "If you's cares for your boyfriend then tell him to get the money, and if you's boyfriend care about you he will".

"We are doing everything we can" said nearly in tears, "what else can I do" she asked.

"Bingo," thought Chidy

"Well you might come and work for my boss" Chidy replied more neutral now.

Nina was surprised, that did not sound so bad. "What sort of work?" she inquired.

"All sorts of jobs Chidy replied slyly. "We need delivery people or girls to help organise parties, dancers at Mr Adebayo club, or working in the spa, we have lots of jobs, what can you do.

"I am a trainee accountant" Nina said brightly seeing hope for her love.

Chidy smirked, all Nina saw was a flash of teeth. "You come alone on Saturday morning and meet Mr Adebayo and you can discuss it with him".

Nina went to bed that night with Des, in her mind she would go to work for Mr Adebayo, save her love who in turn would be undyingly grateful to her. She made Des wait downstairs as she changed into her new underwear, before calling him up and letting him unwrap her like a gift. They made love but Des seemed distracted, they both fell into a troubled sleep.

By Saturday morning Nina was nervous, she went over everything she had been told, it sounded reasonable, but she felt something was not right. Des warned her that these people were not to be crossed but if she did as she was told she would be safe. He seemed stressed which in turn worried Nina.

They woke early and Des helped pick out a pale blue floral dress for Nina. They left the house at 8 in the morning and Des driver her. Nina could tell there was tension but did not know how to broach the subject. Neither spoke as Des drove the silent Nina to Brixton.

They stopped in a street of ornate Victorian terraced houses, close to the border with the London borough of Clapham, the gentrified part of Brixton.

Des had struggled to find a parking space on this Saturday morning but the parking spaces were full of off-roaders that would never go out of London and was nearly in a panic lest he be late.

He found a space eventually and parked up. He turned to Nina "Give me your phone" Des asked.

Nina looked at him for the first time, "Why?" She asked a voice barely a whisper.

"I'll look after it, and I will pick you up later, they will call me, if you keep it they they might lose it" Des said. Knowing that they would search her and a phone would be assumed to be bugged and immediately smashed and letting her would only serve to frighten Nina.

Des took her hand and gripped it. He looked at her fully for the first time. "Look, when you are in there, just agree okay? What ever they tell you just says yes and you will be alright. Any problems and we can sort it out later, promise me you will just say yes?"

Nina nodded dumbly not knowing what to say.

They exited the car, Des came around the pavement took Nina's hand and led her to the door of number 17. As they approached the door swung open before Des could reach for the bell and an unsmiling Chidy stood before them. Des realised they must have been on CCTV, Des nodded and without a word or catching Nina's eye turned and left. Shame burning in his cheeks.

While Nina was in love with Des, she had a long-repressed wild streak, one she kept firmly in control but in the past when she was forced and could no longer have control she could give in and embrace it, giving her an illicit thrill. As she stood on the threshold of a stranger's house, a large and threatening individual in front of her, his eyes seeming to be dead and boring into her, she started to feel aroused, she could feel her knickers getting wet. She liked to be dominated.

"Get in" Chidy demanded nd jerked his head to indicate the same and she hesitated before she stepped over the threshold, the street seemed perfectly respectable not some slum, nothing really bad could happen in such a place. Chidy immediately closed the door and locked both the door and the heavy-duty security bar.

"I'm Nina" Nina said nervously as she watched the man locking the means of exit, Chidy ignored her, he didn't need to know names of his merchandise.

Chidy opened the door to the front room and switched on the lights. "Stand there" he said indicating the space in front of the white rear wall.

He picked up a large DSLR camera with a large ring flash around the lens, he pointed it at Nina. "Smile," he said.

Nina did her best. Chidy took a couple of close-ups and the stepped back. "Turn around, slowly".

Nina complied and as she did Nina nervously asked "What are these for?"

Chidy ignored her. Taking the camera we went to the door. "Mr Adebayo will see you now".

There was a method in what Chidy was doing, each demand she gave into was getting her further down the process of getting her to comply. It was frog boiling, she was getting used to the water.

Chidy led her upstairs, Nina's heart was thumping and her legs felt shaky. The house was large and Chidy took her along the landing to the back bedroom, he opened the door without knocking and stood aside to let Nina through.

Mr Adebayo's bedroom was a reflection of the man himself: modern, meticulous, and designed to impress. Half the bedroom was built in a modern extension which jutted out from the original Victorian building. The space was dominated by a large, king-sized bed with pristine cream sheets and gold-accented pillows, perfectly in line with the room's predominantly white, cream, and gold palette. The bed stood beneath a massive mirror framed in gold, which hung on the white walls, amplifying the sense of space and light.

Floor-to-ceiling windows stretched across one side of the room, flooding it with natural light during the day and offering an imposing view of the city lights at night, Nina could just make out the green of the gardens below. Sheer white curtains framed the windows, softening the sunlight and creating an airy, tranquil atmosphere. Despite the large south-facing window, the room was cool and hum of an air conditioning unit was audible.

Despite the room's modern and minimalist design, there was a deliberate touch of opulence, from the gold trim on the furnishings to the polished surfaces that caught the light just so. Directly opposite Nina was an African wooden mask with dark strips marked its cheeks, the eyes staring sightlessly at Nina, making her shiver.

Nina's eyes shifted to Mr Adebayo had been sitting in a high-backed cream leather armchair reading a newspaper with a rum and a cigar, he put them down and looked at Nina silently. He was dressed in a cream collarless shirt with a pale pattern embossed on it. He had a gold chain with a cross on his chest and his large gold Rolex on his wrist.

"I am Mr Adebayo" he said, "You know why you are here?"

Nina bit her lip and nodded, not fully understanding but knowing she had no choice.

"Your boyfriend is in trouble, a lot of trouble" Mr Adebayo went on. "You are here to start get him out of trouble, you hear me, girl?"

Nina was silent, she twisted her fingers in nervousness and moved her head in what might have been a nod. Ever since she had arrived her subconscious had been aware of the danger in this house, something told her to be scared, despite what Des had told her. She did not like being in the bedroom one bit but with the other man behind her guarding the now-closed door there was not much choice.

Mr Adebayo stood up from the chair and crossed in front of Nina to sit on the bed, the smell of the cigar followed him, not just tobacco, but cannabis mixed in with it.

"Come here girl" he demanded. Nina mindful of what Des had asked her took two steps towards him when he grabbed her hand, twisted and effortlessly laid her across his lap. He pulled up the skirt of her dress exposing her lilly white buttocks and pale panties.

"What are you... arrrh" gasped Nina as Mr Adebayo's hand stuck hard on her buttocks, she was more surprised than hurt, but half a second later another blow, harder this time and made her buttocks sting. She cried out in pain and alarm as a third blow struck her, she turned her head to see Chidy watching her, expressionless but with greedy eyes.

The blows carried on, and Nina started to cry, tears of humiliation running down her face. One hand was hitting her the other was between her shoulder blades holding her down, she squirmed ineffectually. She sensed Chidy come closer and felt his hands coming around her neck, he was putting a collar on her. She felt it mildly constrict her throat as he tightened it.

The blows easy off, and Mr Adebayo's hand started to caress her buttocks, now flushed pink. The contrast to the pain was alluring. "Beg girl" Mr Adebayo demanded.

Surprised Nina replied "Pardon?".

"Beg I don't beat you properly" he angrily replied.

Chidy had gone to a cupboard and brought out a black whip with many short leather stands and handed it to Mr Adebayo, who used to slash across Nina's bum. Nina tried to stifle a yelp of pain.

"Beg you arrogant bitch" Mr Adebayo repeated and hit her again.

Nina was silent, confused and not wanting to beg.

Thwack, the whip came down hard, the pain was sharp and intense and she cried out properly this time. "Beg" Mr Adebayo demanded again. He hooked his thumb under her knickers and pulled them down to her thighs. "Beg" he demanded again.

A third time the whip lashed across her bare buttocks and upper thighs, the pain seemed unbearable "Okay, I'm sorry" Nina cried, "stop, please stop".

"Why should I stop?" Mr Adebayo demanded.

"I can work for you" Nina said plaintively, realising how weak it sounded.

"What can you do for me girl", Mr Adebayo demanded.

"I can do bookkeeping" Nina said hopefully.

Without warning he hit her again, surprised Nina cried out, and a blizzard of blows followed. By the time they ended Nina was howling in fear and pain.

After he had finished Nina thought she would pass out, but there pause, she could not see through the tears but she felt something cool now on her buttocks, it took some of the stinging away, and she felt Mr Adebayo's fingers caress her buttocks.

"Will you do something for me now" Mr Adebayo asked calmly.

Nina nodded, anything but more pain.

He helped her to feet and stood up, but then laid his hand on Nina's shoulder, and he forcefully pushed her down onto her knees, with his other hand he undid his zip and pulled out his semi-erect penis.

Nina kept her mouth shut as Mr Adebayo slapped his erect penis around her face impatiently. Chidy came up behind her and slapped the side of her head, not hard by his standards but it made Nina's head ring, she cried "No, I won't" she said in defiance.

Chidy got out his phone, he dialled, Nina could hear it ringing.

"Find Des, and slit his throat. Do it now and get a video" he said to the unknown individual on the other end of the call.

"No, don't" Nina sobbed. Chidy looked at her.

"Wait" he relayed. Nina turned to face Mr Adebayo, she reached out taking his black shaft in her hand, she looked up imploringly hoping to find some mercy, but Mr Adebayo just looked impatient. Nina took the tip of his penis in her mouth, and started to lick and suck the head of his penis, her other hand went to play with his testicles.

"Stop for now" Chidy and put the phone away in his picked.

"Stand up" Mr Adebayo demanded, Nina stood.

"Strip, let me see you" Mr Adebayo said next

Nina stood up in her pale blue dress, there was silence, two sets of eyes stared at her, waiting for her reaction, the tension was palatable.

Nina's head was down, defeated, Slowly Nina's hand went to her shoulder, her fingers running up the soft fabric of her dress until it reached the straps across her shoulders, she hesitated and Chidy's eyes narrowed, he was about to step forward to strip her naked himself when her fingers slide under the strap and she eased the dress off her shoulder, then the other shoulder and she let the dress crumple to the floor.

She stood there in her pale pink bra and panty set, despite these she felt more naked than she ever had.

"Turn around" Mr Adebayo ordered, quietly this time, his eyes betraying wolfish hunger.

Slowly Nina started to turn, when she reached halfway Mr Adebayo told her to stop, she was facing the bed and the big mirror above the bed and could see both her reflection and the two men behind. Mr Adebayo stood up and both men came behind her. Nina flinched as they touched her, but this time it was gentle caresses. Chidy with expert precision opened her bra with one hand and she let him take if off exposing her small pale breasts, each nipple erect, her chest flushed with desire.

Fear gripped Nina, and she naively decided she had enough, she stood up and went to pick up her clothes from the floor. Chidy watched her as she bent down made a grab for her clothes and turned around intent on making for the door. The punch was delivered from only a few centimetres and at a fraction of the power he was capable of but the force caused Nina's diaphragm to spasm, and briefly Nina could not breathe, she dropped her clothes and bent double, gasping for air. Chidy grabbed her arm and lifted her straight to help her breathe.

"Don't do that again" he commanded looking directly into her eyes, she desperately nodded to accept this.

Chidy gripped her forearm and marched her to the bed, he roughly pushed her on and pushed her into the middle of the bed. Nina cried out and looked around, but there was no possibility of escape, as Chidy kept a vice-like grip on her arm, Nina was still in shock and did not resist, her mind was refusing to accept what was happening.

Chidy climbed onto the bed and straddled her across her chest, pinning her. He took her right hand and from behind the pillow, where it had been hidden, Chidy pulled a black leather restraint with red satin lining, the cuff was open and had thick velcro straps which would be bound around the wrist or ankle making it impossible to open by pulling on it. The restraint was attached to a black leather strap secured to the bedframe.

Chidy laid the cuff on the bed placed Nina's right wrist in it and pulled the straps tight, Nina tried to look up and see what Chidy was doing above her head, but he manoeuvred her into the middle of the bed and was similarly restraining her left arm. Nina realising what was going on now wriggled and kicked her free legs. "No, stop, no get off me" Nina pleaded.

Nina thrashed her legs in a panic now, but she felt powerful hands grab her leg and guided it into a restraint.

Chidy leaned back and his arm held down her other leg as Mr Adebayo went to the other side of the bed and Nina felt him press her foot down while he bound that ankle. She cried out but to no avail.

Chidy fetched a triangular-shaped pillow and pushed the wedge end under Nina's buttocks, slapping her to get her to lift herself so he could get it fully under her, once done he took another leather strap from the top of the bed and bending Nina's leg attached them to the left ankle restraint that Mr Adebayo had just put on her. He considered gagging her, but Mr Adebayo enjoyed hearing his victims plead and she was not being too much trouble.

Chidy moved around the bed as Mr Adebayo watched with evident satisfaction, he finished by pulling the straps tight. Nina pulled against the leather cuffs, the soft smooth velvet was deceptive she could not move them a fraction. Nina was completely prone now, naked, spread eagle on Mr Adebayo's bed, her buttocks in the air, her legs splayed out and her vulva ripe and ready, slick with her excitement. Her head rested on satin pillows and she could only watch as Mr Adebayo stripped off his suit. It hit her then what was going to happen, part of her was terrified, but part of her was excited. Her vagina tingled in anticipation and she could feel how wet she had become.

Meanwhile, Des had travelled home desperately trying not to think of what he had just done. He was pragmatic about this, but he did not like it.

Des tried to watch TV to take his mind of what was happening to Nina, but no matter what he tried to do his mind kept going back to Nina and what she would be forced to do. He pictured them, Nina on her back, orgasming as Adebayo rutted, her shooting his seed into her, potentially getting her pregnant.

To Des's surprise and at first bewilderment he got an erection. After an hour of trying not to give in he gave up and slipped his hand down his trousers and masturbated furious all the while thinking of Nina and Adebayo. He still could not get Nina out of his mind, and it was at this point that he realised that she meant more to him than he realised up to that point. He slammed his fist onto the table in anger and frustration.

Back in Brixton Mr Adebayo was on the bed now, lying next to Nina, he played with Nina's breasts licking and sucking on her nipples. His hand went down to explore her crotched. Nina tried to avoid his touch but had limited movement. She felt a thick finger part her labia and lazily play with her clitoris. She made little mewing sounds as Mr Adebayo explored his new plaything.

Chidy went to the wardrobe and took out some apparatus which Nina could not make out. He returned to the bed and Nina saw a metal canister with a valve and tubes coming from it. He placed it on the floor next to the head of the bed and Nina could hear the valve opening and audible hiss.

Chidy stood up, trailing the tube and a pale blue mask from the gas canister, he took an experimental suck from the mask and satisfied that the gas was flowing, passed the mask to Mr Adebayo, who took it and straddled Nina his erect penis resting on her stomach. With a smile he leaned forward and clamped the mask firmly over Nina's mouth and nose.

Nina was confused and frightened of this sudden new thing, she tried to shake her head and escape the mask but Chidy put his hand around her, constricting it and holding her still, she couldn't escape the mask. She pulled against the restraints but they were absolutely firm, she was utterly helpless.

With no other choice, Nina took a breath, she tried to only sip the air, but instead, she took a deep breath inhaling the gas and air mix, she immediately felt a head rush, followed by a feeling of being light-headed and euphoric, she relaxed a little and took another breath. Nina felt totally controlled now, and her arousal went off the scale, she squirmed against the constraints not to escape but to feel how trapped she was, muscles tightened with tension so she could barely breathe, and she arched her head back in sexual agony.

Mr Adebayo watched as Nina ineffectively struggled against the constraints, he noted how her eyes rolled back and the mewing noises she made, he grinned with satisfaction as he forced her legs further apart and moved his body between them, pressing his erect penis against her vagina and removing the mask from Nina's face dropped it to one side so he could use his left hand to guide his erection into Nina.

Mr Adebayo's thick erect penis gently and slowly entered Nina, stretching the lips of her vagina as he penetrated her. Nina shuddered and groaned as her desire was fulfilled. Her mind was a quandary of desire and revulsion. The gas did not help. She knew she was trapped, that Mr Adebayo's naked penis was inside her, slipping in and out of her. She sobbed weakly, the sight of this exciting Mr Adebayo further. She tried to will away the pleasure but failed utterly. The bliss was overwhelming her.

Mr Adebayo now went full bore, brutally pounding away at the slim prone body of Nina, with his right he gripped Nina's throat expertly constricting it, enough to reduce the flow of oxygen to her brain but not enough to do permanent damage. Nina whimpered but her back arched and she moved her hips to better accommodate the thrusts from Mr Adebayo. She closed her eyes and pictured herself tied to the bed, this evil man on top of her, she started to softly moan in pleasure. The tension she had built up over the last few days was dissolving under the relentless pounding of Mr Adebayo,

Nina still tried to struggle but there was nothing she could do, her body seemed disassociated with her now, and her whole body tensed as a body-wracking orgasm built in her. It came seconds later, the most intense orgasm of her life, the mild oxygen starvation intensifying the feeling, "Ohhhh" She could not help herself from shouting out as her vagina spasmed gripping Mr Adebayo, and he came, ejaculating his semen into her.

Nina opened her eyes in time to see Mr Adebayo cum, his eyes closed and joy on his face. Nina could see Chidy watching the couple. She felt humiliated and shameful "it has to be over" she thought to herself.

Mr Adebayo got up put on a dressing gown, and went to the armchair. Chidy was watching him, his eyes now narrow slits, expectant and menacing. Mr Adebayo took out a new cigar, chopped the end off and lit it with a gold-plated lighter, he sucked on it a couple of times to get it going, checked that the tip was glowing to his liking and looked up at Chidy. He nodded to him and went back to his paper.

Chidy silently walked to the head of the bed and lifting Nina's dazed head slipped a burgundy-coloured silk blindfold over her head and covered her eyes. Next he released the clips which connected the straps to the leather cuffs and roughly helped her up. As Nina sat up, Chidy attached a lease to her collar and tugged it, "C'mmon" was the only word he uttered.

Nina tried to reach the blindfold but Chidy had other ideas and slapped her hand away, "Don't do that again girl" he said and tugged on the lease again, reluctantly Nina swung her long slim legs over the side of the bed and stood up.

"Turn around" Chidy barked, Nina submissive now complied.

Chidy took a strap which he clipped onto a ring on the back of the black leather collar she was wearing. He then clipped the cuffs to the bottom of the strap immobilising her arms behind her back. It reminded Chidy of the images of slavery he had seen. Now it was happening to this white girl he thought with satisfaction. Aside from the cuffs and blindfold Nina was still naked.

Chidy led her to the door and walked her out.

Chidy led her down the landing to the staircase, instead of going down he took her up, gripping her upper arm so she would not fall. Blindfolded Nina was very aware of her other senses, the carpet under her bare toes, the coolness of the air on her nipples, the squeak of one of the stairs. She could feel semen leaking out of her vagina and running coldly down her leg.

They reached the landing and after a few steps Chidy opened a door and led Nina into another room. He sat her down on a soft fabric armchair and Nina could hear his feet as they padded out of the room, the swish of the door on the carpet and the click as Chidy closed the door.

The room was silent but Nina sensed it was not empty, while her arms were restrained she could get up, but yet she stayed sitting, trying to make sense of what was happening to her.

After a minute she heard movement as if someone was getting up, the soft sound of the fabric moving.

Mr Adebayo Senior was Mr Adebayo's 74-year-old father, he had been a mid-level gangster in his time and Mr Adebayo was all about respect, and had arranged for this father to come to the UK, far away from the chaos of Lagos. His first name was Onnah and despite his advanced years he was fit and still had strong sexual urges, he had also taken Viagra an hour ago and was anticipating the gift from his son. Her breasts and arse were small he thought, but she was beautiful. Like his son, he had a fetish for white girls.

Onnah stood up from the bed, the bed making slight noises, which he noted the white girl heard. He took a small brown bottle with no markings on it from the table next to the bed, it was a concoction he brought from a traditional healer back in Nigeria, it was sold as an aphrodisiac, whether or not it was truly an aphrodisiac he could not tell, but it made the girls pliant and submissive, that he knew and it was enough.

He poured the greenish liquid into a cup sniffed it to make sure it had not gone off and walked over to where Nina was sitting.

Onnah stroked Nina's cheek, he could smell the sweet smell of her sexual juices emanating from her vagina, and he started to get an erection.

"Drink this" he said. His voice was deep and resonant, his strong Nigerian accent shaped every syllable. He put the cup to Nina's lips.

"What is it?" Nina asked in a quiet voice., she had no idea who this man was or what he was going to do.

"Just drink girl" Onnah replied with a touch of irritation, he tipped the cup and held the back of her head. The first taste was not bad, sweet, with a flavour she did not recognise. As she was a little thirsty she drank more, as she finished she noted a slightly bitter taste and a tingling in her mouth and throat.

Onnah knew it would take 5 minutes for the aphrodisiac to take effect, we went to lie on the bed to save his energy, leaving the bound and blindfolded girl to sit alone.

Nina waited, she started to feel light-headed and she struggled to think straight, like after she had had too many drinks, eventually, she heard clothes being pulled off, a zipper being pulled down and trousers being dropped on the floor. She did not worry now, she felt she was floating and completely disassociated from her surroundings.

A hand gripped her arms gently lifting her, she stood up her body bumped into a semi-erect penis. The hands turned her around she felt the clips being undone behind her, and then the eye mask was slipped off her head.

Nina looked around the room, she saw the bed first and then turned to look at the man who had released her. Onnah Adebayo his frizzy hair was white and Nina was surprised by his age, like his son he was tall, and his lean frame was still fit and commanding. His dark skin, rich and almost ebony, was smooth for his age, with only a few lines etched into his face, marks of a life lived with intensity. He had the same, watchful eyes that seemed to miss nothing, they stared now at Nina with naked lust.

Onnah leaned forward and kissed Nina, his hands grabbed her buttocks and he pulled her towards him. As if in a trance Nina kissed him back, as if someone else was in control of her body and she was just along for the ride. The elderly man's tongue slipped into her mouth and automatically she played with it with her own tongue.

She felt a finger touching her clitoris and she murmured in appreciation.

Onnah took her hand and led her to the bed, he turned to face her and indicated for her to climb onto the bed first, he did not know her name and had no intention of asking but he indicated she should move to the middle and he climbed next to her, they kissed again and he placed his fingers in her pussy, rubbing her clitoris. Nina's breathing changed, something inside her was screaming for this to stop but her body reacted to the stimulation and she opened her legs wider and moaned sensually. She wondered why she was so aroused.

Onnah's penis despite the Viagra was only semi erect. He needed more stimulation. He took Nina's hand and placed it on his penis, and got her to start to masturbate him. They carried on kissing while Nina distractedly played with his penis.

After a bit Onnah said "You suck me now girl". He gently tugged her hair and the dazed Nina wiggled down and took his penis in her mouth. He smelt different, an old man's smell, it shocked Nina as she thought about how old he was. But she already had his penis in her mouth and was stroking his shaft, she felt it getting harder, the old man's hand on the back of her head pressured her down. "Why am I turned on by this?" Nina thought, she could feel how wet her vagina was, "he has to be 80".

Onnah was fully hard now, he sprung into action, sitting upright and trying to position Nina below him on the bed. Nina was aroused and submissive, she let him until he was on top of her, "I can't have sex with such an old man" she thought, the humiliation would be too much.

Nina struggled arbetly weakly forcing Onnah to bare down on her with his weight, his hands pinning her shoulders to the mattress. Onnah considered calling for Chidy to restrain her but her defiance excited him. He had one leg between hers and was pressing down with his other knee, spreading her legs apart. His penis touched her vagina and Onnah felt how wet she was. He could feel his erection getting even harder.

Nina did not want to be taken again and not by such an old man. But she felt weak and part of her was sexually excited and attracted to someone who she would normally be repelled by.

Suddenly he was inside her, and the knowledge broke Nina, she stopped resisting and accepted this old man's naked penis inside her. Due to his age, Onnah was surprisingly gentle and slow. He kissed her, Nina being inert at first, until again as if on auto-pilot she kissed him back, she spread her legs a little more to accommodate him, and angled her hips to accept his thrusting manhood. Onnah, knew to finish he would need to take it slow, when he was younger it was different but now he needed a lot of stimulation.

Nina was surprised to feel the tension building in her vagina, earlier had been animalistic and frightening, but this was gentle and slow, from when she had given in she had merely felt a nice sensation as the old man thrust into her, but now the thrusts felt incredibly long doing deep inside her, she raised her hips a little more, "oh", that was the spot, her breathing changed, she took rapid gasps of air, it hit her, she could feel her vagina clenching his penis, but still he kept thrusting, he was panting now, the feel of his penis inside her almost unbearable for a minute.

Onnah needed time, he kept the same rhythm, desperate to reach an orgasm with this delicate young girl.

She was moaning in pleasure and gripping his penis delightful. Onnah felt his own rigidity and imagined his seed in this beautiful, sexy white girl. She bucked beneath him as she orgasms, he looked down her eyes were open, wide in shock at the experience, he climaxed spilling his seed into her vagina.

He rolled off her, exhausted and limp now. Nina lay still, coming down from the high, still dazed by the orgasms and the aphrodisiac the old man had made her drink.

Quietly the door opened and Chidy came into the room. Onnah was asleep, and Chidy helped Nina up, he gently pinned her arms behind her back with his large powerful hands and clipped the cuffs together. Nina's head hung down and she offered no resistance.

"Come" he ordered gruffly, handled her towards the door. He grabbed the blindfold and placed it over her head, a light darkness closed in around Nina. Chidy took her arms and guided her out of the room.

Slowly they descended the stairs, Nina hoped that it was not back to Mr Adebayo, but Chidy led her down the next flight of stairs. Nina briefly hoped he would release her now, but that vain hope dissolved as he opened another door and took her down another flight of stairs to the basement.

In a tiled hallway, Chidy stopped, he let go of her arm, took out a set of keys, and opened a door, he marched Nina in and took off the blindfold. Nina took the new room in. It was another bedroom, narrower with dark green wallpaper, and subdued lighting, a large bed dominated, a monster TV faced it and behind the bed, there were built-in wardrobes. The room had no windows perhaps to counter this, there was art on the wall, and at the far end of the room was an open door which Nina could see an en suite, The room had a touch of luxury, and felt like an upmarket hotel room, or a luxury sort of prison.

Nina thought Chidy would demand sex now, but he took off the restraint and without a word gave her a bottle of water and left, taking the cuffs with him. Nina heard the sound of a key turning in the lock. After the fear of the last few days, the multiple ravishings the old man's elixir, she felt weak and exhausted, she checked the bathroom and cleaned herself up, wiping the semen from her vagina. The need to feel clean overtook the desire for sleep and she washed herself, luxuriating in the feel of the hot water and the scent of the body wash.

Next to the shower, neatly folded on a table there were several thick soft towels and robes, all an off-white cream. She took the robe, and put it on, covering finally her naked body, it was the softest of kinds of cotton. She took a towel and wrapped up her hair. She looked in a mirror, searching for signs of the ordeal, she looked back at herself, "How did I get here" she wondered to herself.

In a search of the cupboard in the bathroom, she found a set of new toiletries and a hair dryer, along with male and female fragrances, moisturiser, condoms, and lubricant. She took a toothbrush out of its packet and thoroughly brushed her teeth before drying her hair with the hairdryer, the noise felt scary like she might remind the men that she was there. Clean and fresh, she felt better but even more tired, her arms felt heavy and she was struggling to keep her eyes open.

Despite this Nina returned to the bedroom, and started to search, checking the wardrobe first she was looking for her clothes or at least some clothes. She found a number of outfits, a nurse, waitress, school uniform, witch, and even a couple of outfits Nina recognised as in the colours of Hogwarts, along with draws of sex toys. "Where am I" she thought to herself, she chose not to swell on that question.

None of the outfits were much better than being naked, and after a brief search, she gave up and tried the door. As expected it was locked. Fatigue washed over Nina, the bed looked inviting, she lifted the cover and was relieved to find it clean and fresh-smelling. She climbed in, and tried to think of what to do but was asleep before she could finish that thought.

Nina woke gently from a dream she could not quite remember, and after blinking her eyes open, lay quiet and still, thinking of where she was, not wanting to risk disturbing the unseen men she knew must be in the house. She could feel the bruises on her buttocks from the beating she had taken yesterday, not painful as such but noticeable.

"It must be Sunday now," she thought. Questions flooded her mind in a confused jumble as she recalled yesterday's events: "I can't believe I slept here. How do I get home? What time is it? Where is Des?"

She looked around the room, wondering what to do. The room was long, the walls painted a rich dark green that was offset by matching cream skirting boards, dado rails, and cornices, the electrical fitters were all brushed gold, and the deep cream carpet gave the room the feeling of a luxury hotel. A couple of light and airy abstract paintings highlighted by discrete ceiling lights gave the room some sense of space since there were no windows. Nina knew it was underground, having been taken down the stairs yesterday. The room was a pleasant warmth, the air was fresh and not musty.

At one end of the room was the entrance door, also painted a dark shade of green with gilt handles, along with a set of fitted wardrobes. An upholstered ottoman sat in the middle of that section. Further up, a partition wall came halfway across the room dividing the wardrobes and the bed, the partition supported a large mirror in front of a dressing table on one side and a large television facing the bed.

The other side of the partition was an enormous king-sized double bed. The bed cover was a luxury heavy cotton satin, also in matching dark green, with fine high-count white cotton sheets underneath. Each side of the beds had dark wooden side tables, and the door to the large ensuite bathroom was to the left.

On the wall next to the corridor was an upholstered green chaise longue, and a console table which arranged neatly were several plastic bottles of water. Overall it was a tasteful, expensively decorated cell.

Nina realised she had no idea what time it was, only that she was hungry thirsty and needed to use the toilet. She rolled over and looked over the side of the bed for the robe, she knew she dropped last night, but it was neatly folder on an the chaise longue a couple of meters away, there were also new bottles of water on the consul table as well, someone had been in the room while she was asleep, the thought made her shiver.

However, the impulse to pee was getting stronger and she climbed out of the bed, covering her nakedness as best she could and hopped over to the chaise longue and the robe.

As she sat on the toilet she looked around her surroundings, wondering how she could get out. Her eyes eventually spotted the CCTV camera on the ceiling, a red light blinked on it. Her heart sank, she looked around, there was another one pointing directly at the shower, every bit of the bathroom was covered. She pulled the robe closer around her and allowed herself to think over the events of yesterday. She closed her eyes and remembered being strapped down, how the restraints felt when we tried to pull on them, the weight of that man pressing down on her, his smell, the feel of his penis inside her, the strength of the orgasm which almost made her pass out. She shook her head and tried to stop thinking about it.

When she went back to the bedroom she found more cameras in the ceiling. She tried the door again, but it was still locked, she realised she was a prisoner and the thought made her heart jolt. She considered for a moment knocking to get someone's attention, but she feared to meet with these men again, especially as she had nothing on but the robe.

So as quietly as possible she explored the room, first silently opening the doors to the fitted wardrobes. Hanging from the rail were a series of outfits on hangers. Nina looked through them, wincing at the noise as one of the hangers squeaked against the rail. She lifted one of the outfits out, it was a white cotton doctor's outfit, a red cross embroidered on the breast and a deep v in the top, the length went down to the top of Nina's thighs, the other outfits were similar, maid, Emirates airline stewardess (which looked real), witch, pirate, cat girl, 4 outfits she recognised as Hogwarts uniforms and several sets of skimpy but expensive underwear.

Next, she silently opened the draws one by one, in them she found a huge range of vibrators and other sex toys in a range of colours and sizes, and a range of leather items, most she had no idea what they were, there were condoms, lubricants and even chocolate body paint.

At least she had water and got back into bed, getting under the covers still in the robe and sipped from the opened plastic bottle as she pondered over what to do. She thought about Des, wondering if he would rescue her, her mind wondered briefly to imagining the door opening and Des being there, bruised but unbeaten, there to save her. She felt guilty about the day before, and embarrassed if Des found out. She knew she loved Des and wanted to get back to him.

Chidy had been watching her on the screen since she woke. She had been out for over 14 hours, she would be well rested now. Chidy got the cook to get food for her and carried on watching her while it was prepared.

Nina jumped when she heard the lock click and the door open. She looked around guiltily as if she had been caught doing something wrong. Her heart raced as adrenaline surged through her body.

The door swung open and an elderly black man came in with a tray which he lay on the side table. From under his arm, he took a folding bed tray table, opened it out and unbidden lay the tray on the bed across the bed over Nina, before be placed the the tray.

"Where are my clothes" Nina asked in a whisper, the man ignored her. Instead, he poured coffee from an ornate silver pot into a cup. The rich smell of the coffee filled the room and made Nina realise how hungry she was.

"I want to go," she asked again quietly, the man said nothing, he stared at her for a moment, his eyes seemed soulful and somewhat sad and he then turned and walked out of the room. Nina could see Chidy outside, guarding the door his expression gave away nothing and he closed the door and locked it again, the click in the lock somewhat ominous.

Nina smelt the food and realised how famished she was. She lifted the cover on the tray and found a stack of pancakes and jam in a little pot, she sat on the edge of the bed and ate. Before she was finished the door lock clicked and Chidy came in. Nina eyed him fearfully.

"You will pay off your boyfriend's debt" Chidy declared calmly in a matter-of-fact tone.

Chidy carried on "Tonight you will go out with a man, and you will do everything he tells you, everything. If we get a good report Mr Adebayo will let you go. If we don't it will be bad for you and very bad for Des."

Nina said nothing gripping the bed cover. Chidy's words were failing to make sense to her. She was in denial of what was happening.

Chidy knew that if given all the information at once girls would immediately say no and while they would all break sooner or later, the process took time and could result in damage to the merchandise. Nina was premium merchandise and she was not to be marked.

Much better to lead them step by step, she had agreed to come here to do a job, then she had been photographed without being asked, followed by a beating and making her accept her boyfriend's debts, then a blow job, the being stripped, the rape, the raped again, and then to be imprisoned.

The real trick was to make her a prisoner in her own mind. Chidy was experienced in this. The next step was to agree to prostitute herself.

There was silence, Chidy stared at her unblinking. Finally, Nina said in a quiet scared voice "I can't, there must be another way".

Chidy just stared at her, and the tension built up, he knew the first stage was denial. The second ticked by, Nina felt the silence oppressive Nina noticed how bloodshot his eyes were, she had to break the silence. "Please there must be another way, I want to go home now" she begged a hint of desperation in her voice.

"There is no other way," Chidy said firmly, leaving no room for argument.

"I won't do it" Nina said more firmly "I want to leave now" She put emphasis on the last word.

With an icy calmness, Chidy simply said "No".

Nina swallowed, she said with all the bravery she could muster "I am leaving, you can't stop me". She said it slowly and deliberately, anger giving an edge to her words.

"Okay then" Chidy said a slow amused smiling playing on his face, he lifted the tray off the bed and placed it on the table, he returned to the bed and looked down at Nina, despite her words Nina had not moved, waiting for permission to act on her words.

Chidy jerked he head towards the door "get up and leave" he said evening a trace of a smirk playing across his mouth.

He leaned forward and pressed the bed covers down, pinning Nina to the bed. Nina wiggled and twisted, but could not get her arms free.

"Come little girl, get up and leave" Chidy taunted her. Nina looked up at him furiously, still struggling.

Eventually, Chidy let go of the covers and stood up, Nina stopped struggling and angrily threw the covers off, and attempted to stand up, all the while gripping the robe closely around her.

She grunted with shock as Chidy hit her in the solar plexus, winding her and making her gasp as the air was forced from her lungs, the blow was gentle by Chidy's standards, it would not leave a mark. Chidy grabbed her hair forcing her head back and with the other hand stripped the robe off her. Nina was barely able to breathe let alone scream.

Chidy turned her around and bent her over the bed, Nina's breath came in short gasps as she struggled for breath, and hot tears rolled down her cheeks. "He is going to rape me" she thought.

Chidy twisted her arm behind her back, pinning her so she could not move, and inflicting a small amount of pain. He leaned over her, close to her ear and said in a menacing voice "Let me explain, and you better listen girl as I won't repeat myself. Understand?"

He paused to let this sink in.

"Understand?" he demanded again twisting her arm a little more, Nina whimpered and nodded. Chidy took his time, knowing that every second that he controlled her like this would help him. He was a master at this.

In a harsh tone, Chidy told her what this meant, "Your boyfriend has sold you to us, that means we own you, now Des ain't going to fix this, he ain't coming for you, if he does I will slit his throat while you watch, only you can fix this, you do this for your boyfriend... and for you".

Chidy went on more softly "Your not a virgin, we have seen the videos of you and Des and his friends, you are already a whore, you are merely doing with our friends, not those of your boyfriend."

He paused to let the words have their effect on Nina's psyche.

"Shall I let you go, and we can talk some more?" he asked more gently. He had felt her resistance ebbing away.

Nina nodded, but Chidy replied "Say please girl"

"Please let me go" Nina whispered.

"NO!" Chidy shouted and squeezed her arm causing her to yelp in surprise and pain.

"You cannot go, you belong to us. You ask me to let you up, not to go, you can never go girl, not until I let you" Chidy said his voice full of menace again, "and call me Sir".

Nina sniffled "Please let me up... sir" The words seemed to make no sense to her, but she was now just repeating what she had been told. Despite her education and job, she was regressing to little more than a slave.

Chidy stood up and released the grip on her arm, but still remained intimately close to her. Nina raised herself and turned seeking to get away. Chidy pushed her back down and growled his disapproval. Nina lay on the bed legs hanging over the side, she was aware that she was completely naked and exposed, she tried to cover her vagina with her hand, her face flushed with embarrassment. Another growl from Chidy stopped her. Her hands froze over her hips.

"Open your legs up, let me look at you" Chidy said calmly this time.

Nina lay there petrified, not moving, Chidy growled, a deep animalist rumbling sound and he started to raise his right arm, but he stopped as Nina compiled. Chidy was satisfied, a line had been crossed and more quickly than he thought it would. The rest would be easy. He stroked the inside of Nina's leg, enjoying the softness and warmth of her skin. There was a little fuzz around her crotch, but that was easily remedied for tonight he thought.

"Get back into bed" Chidy ordered. Gratefully Nina got up and covered herself again. The soft-touch had confused her, and Chidy would confuse her more. She started to felt grateful towards Chidy, something which when she thought back she found inexplicable.

Chidy got himself a bottle of water from the console table and sat on the bed next to Nina. "Show me your omu, your boobs," Chidy said back in his frightening emotionless voice.

Reluctantly and slowly Nina lowered the bed covers, exposing her small but beautiful breasts. Chidy stared at her chest, there was a patch of redness where he had hit her, but that would fade by this evening. He reached out and played with her nipple, which grew more erect. Nina could see her reflection in the TV and she focused on it, trying not to feel aroused. She had noted a terrifying bulge in Chidy's trousers.

Chidy saw Nina concentrating on the TV, she should not have any escape so he reached over to the bedside table, opened the drawer and took out the remote. He switched the TV on and to Nina's horror he selected a channel with a video of her being double penetrated by Des and his friend Wayne, the sound was off but Nina knew exactly what it was. Her eyes were fixed on the screen, Des her boyfriend and love gripping her hips as Wayne his friend took her mouth, she did not even notice how aroused she was by watching this.

Chidy watched her, his predatory eyes noting her reaction and how her nipples were stiff with desire.

"Girl, I have watched these. You give yourself willingly to these men?" he said in a more friendly tone. Nina reluctantly nodded unable to take her eyes off the scene. Her cheeks burned with shame and helplessness.

"This gave you much pleasure and joy?" Chidy said calmly again. Nina said nothing.

Chidy went on "It is such a small thing, something you have done many times before and will do many times in the future. It is a natural thing, a beautiful thing. Is it not?"

Nina bit her lip, as on-screen she appeared to be in the midst of orgasm, unable to keep Wayne's meaty penis in her mouth. She had no will to resist Chidy's cold logic.

"Do this and you will be free, Des will be free", will you do that for Des? It is just one night" Chidy said, encouragingly.

Nina was silent, still staring at the screen as the images displayed Wayne mounting her. Subconsciously she was deeply aroused. One part of her felt she should resist, another part knew she could not and although she could not consciously admit this to herself she didn't want to.

Chidy said again gently "Will you do this?".

Nina bit her lip, in barely a whisper she said "Yes". Chidy was silent, she turned her head to look at him, but could not hold his gaze and lowered her eyes. She nodded reinforcing her acceptance. Chidy knew it would not be the only time, far from it, but it was no point telling her that now.

"Good choice, tonight you will work with another girl, she will look after you, instruct you on what you should do and help you get ready" Chidy said, back to being matter-of-fact. He got up and without another word left the room, locking Nina in again. As he left he heard her sobbing.

Sometime later, she could not tell how long, the lock clicked and the door was pushed open, a young woman came in, she smiled brightly at Nina and introduced herself as Angelika. She was around the same age as Nina, perhaps a year or so younger. She had a soft Eastern European accent but spoke good English. Angelika had long blonde hair tied up in a ponytail, she wore tightfitting pink leggings and a white tight t-shirt. The door closed behind her and the lock clicked.

Nina more composed now, she had been thinking about what Chidy had said, and was sitting in the bed with the covers pulled tightly up to to her neck. She has switched the TV off and the scenes of her making love to her boyfriend and group sex with his friends. She had cried for a bit but was calm now, fearful of everything and she eyed Angelika warily.

Angelika sat on the edge of the bed, she smiled.

"So you're the new girl?" She enquired, "Chidy has asked me to work with you kind of like a mentor he said". Chidy had used the word mentor but had told her in clear terms what would happen to them both if they fucked up tonight. Angelika as a defence mechanism chose to ignore the threats.

"Have you done this before?", Angelika asked innocently correctly deducing that this was Nina's first time, she remembered what that was like and wanted to make it easy for this new girl.

Nina shook her head, not ready to engage with this.

Angelika smiled reassuringly, "It's really not that difficult, I will give you some tips, and don't worry if they get out of hand you can call for help, it is really not that bad here, they look after us". All things are relatively and Angelika was far better off here than with the Albanian pimp who had sold her on.

Angelika chatted away, she was originally from a village in Romania but had no desire to go back. She loved London, she liked shopping, going to the cinema, Gucci and Fendi, Archers and lemonade, clubbing and talking incessantly about herself.

"Romanian women, we love money and we love sex" Angelika said, "So I enjoy my job, it's what I want to do and I make £1,000 a night". All of these were untrue, Angelika only made a fraction of that amount, but equated what the punters paid for her self-worth, and had had no real choice about being a prostitute. Nina confused and still dazed did not question any of it. It was nice to have company which did not scare her.

"So" Angelika said eventually, "tonight we are working together for one punter. He is a VIP guest on an all-nighter, Hopefully, he will get drunk an pass out," she giggled "lots of them do that you know. Anyway Mr Chidy said we need to give him our best service, and that includes bareback if he wants it, do you have a certificate?"

"Certificate?" Nina queried in a daze.

"Yes, check we aren't going to give the punters the clap, well your new to this so won't have anything, but you're on the pill right?"

Nina nodded dumbly, she certainly thought she was. She subconsciously rubbed her belly. Although she did not know it Des's baby was growing in there.

After a bit the cook came and brought food and drinks under the watchful eye of Chidy. Chidy then brought a tray with drinks, spirits, and mixers, of the spirits there were two one clear and one a bottle of greenish liquid. None of the bottles were made out of glass, nothing which could be used as a weapon.

After Chidy had left Angelika got up picked up the green bottle and poured two glasses which she topped up from a bottle of Sprite, she handed one to Nina. "Drink this, it will make your relax"

Nina eyes the greenish drink sceptically, "What is it", she asked.

"Just drink it, it's nice, it will just relax you and it makes it feel better" Angelika replied coyly.

Nina took a small sip, it was a mix of bitter and sweet, but it did not taste strongly alcoholic. Angelika drank half her drink and started to discuss what they would be doing later. Nina sipped hers until Angelika said "Drink up, you'll want another one in you to relax you".

Nina drank it down and Angelika got up to make two more drinks. By the time Nina had finished the second glass she was feeling much more relaxed, the knot of tension she had been feeling had gone., she could breathe normally and the anxiety she had been feeling was nearly gone, in fact, she was starting to feel a little euphoric.

The green drink was a potent mix of plants and herbs from West Africa with aphrodisiac effects. Mr Aboiya had his own preferred supplier in Lagos. The herbs gave the drink its distinctive colour and taste. However, he had discovered by trial and error that small quantities of GHB improved the compliance of girls who drank it. Too much, and they passed out, but he knew the right amount.

Angelika was even more chatty now, she wanted to know all about Nina, who was uninhibited by the effects of the drugs told her about her life, Des (omitting the parts which Nina herself was not comfortable with) and how she had got here. Angelika was sympathetic and kind but told her it would all be okay from now on. Angelika had developed far stronger psychological defences than Nina had. But Nina wanted to believe what she was being told, with the drugs impairing her high brain functions she accepted what she was told without question.

Eventually, Angelika steered the conversation around to work.

"Working together he might want girl on girl, have you done that before" Angelika asked

Nina thought back to Kelly, "No she said"

"Well it's not so bad" Angelika said brightly. "Have you ever kissed a girl".

Nina shook her head. "No problem," Angelika said as she leaned slowly forward. Nina did not move as Angelika got closer but closed her eyes. Angelika's soft lips ever so gently touched hers. Nina found herself leaning in as Angelika's fingers started touching the back of her neck. Their lips pressed together, their bodies touched, and Nina could feel Angelika's breasts against hers. She instinctively slipped one hand behind Angelika, stroking her back.

Ordinarily, Nina did not find other women sexually attractive, the only other time she had been tricked into it by thinking it was her boyfriend kissing and touching her, she had been so aroused she had just gone with it. This was different and confusing, but she needed comfort, needed to be touched, needed someone else to be with her in the face of this frightening experience.

Angelika experimentally touched Nina's tongue with hers, no resistance, so she pulled the knot loose on Nina's robe belt and slipped a hand in so she stroked her hips all the while passionately kissing her.

Angelika was satisfied that Nina would get through this and not get them into trouble. She pulled free "Wow you're a really good kisser" Angelika said flushed and smiling.

Nina felt both disappointment and relief.

Before Nina could say anything there was a triple knock at the door, Angelika explained that this meant they had an hour to get ready.

Nina had been avoiding thinking about what would happen and was surprised to find she was not anxious about this anymore, even a part of her was curious and excited by the prospect. Subconsciously her body was preparing itself, she was getting very wet, and her vagina was softening. Angelika fixed them another drink which relaxed her further.

Angelika led Nina to the bathroom to help her to get ready, first, they stripped careless now of the cameras. Angelika took out products from a cupboard and laid them out. "Shower first" she said "and I will show you how to get ready".

Nina climbed into the large shower and turned on the water adjusting it to a warm stream. She luxuriated in the feel of the water until she heard the door slide open and Angelika joined her. "Let me" Angelika said as she soaped up a pouffe and started to rub it on Nina's back.

Nina decided she did not mind this and let Angelika get on with it. Having finished her back, Angelika went down to Nina's buttocks, then the back of her legs. Nina could feel herself getting aroused. She tried to stop feeling this way but thoughts of Kelly, the man from yesterday dominating her and the touch of Angelika now overwhelmed her.

As Angelika reached around Nina, pressing her naked body against Nina's back, Nina turned and looked at Angelika in the face, she pressed against her, enjoying the feel of her soft slippery skin.

Angelika turned off the shower, took a tub of depilatory cream from the shelf and opened it, both girls covered their legs, armpits and groins in hair-dissolving cream. They stood slightly nervously waiting for the cream to dissolve any body hair. They both smiled nervously when they caught each other's eyes.

Nina wondered what it would be like to lie in bed touching and being touched by Angelika. She was shocked, she tried to clear her mind and thought about Des, Des who she loved and was here to be his saviour. She had an image of sitting in bed with Des on top of Angelika next to her, pounding her fiercely, Angelika's pretty face, looking up at her, her mouth open as she orgasmed....

"How can I be turned on at this" Nina thought to herself, "I must be going mad".

After three minutes Angelika turned the shower on and they washed off the cream using a tool to deal with any remaining hairs. Next Angelika took a tub of moisturiser and massaged Nina all over, including her intimate areas, pressing gently on either side of Nina's vulva.

"My turn," Angelika said once finished and handed Nina the tub of moisturiser. She turned her back and Nina started on her back, Angelika chatted happily while Nina ran her hands up and down her back. Angelika's cheerfulness was contagious, and Nina found herself thinking less about what she was doing here. Her hands naturally moved from her back to her buttocks.

Angelika was worried, she knew what would happen if there was a complaint. She also knew that men liked girl-on-girl action. She didn't want to be punished if Nina backed out, Nina was sexy and cute, but a rookie, and underlying the chatty persona Angelika was afraid.

Nina crouched to rub lotion into Angelika's still-damp legs. Angelika smiled and opened her legs so that Nina's hands could get everywhere. She eventually turned and Nina stood up, "front next" Angelika said her voice slightly deeper, her chest and cheeks flushed.

Nina took more moisturiser and started on her shoulders, Angelika tried to make eye contact but Nina was avoiding it, Angelika took her hands and placed them on her breasts, Nina looked up and could not help but smile at Angelika's impish look. Slowly at first she worked the moisturiser into Angelika's breasts, they were the softest and smoothest skin she had ever known. Angelika's nipples were erect and hard. Each time Nina's hand curled Angelika's breasts they would pop out from under Nina's hand.

Without saying anything Angelika moved forward and kissed Nina again. Nina was less resisting this time so Angelika moved closer, their naked skin touching, their breasts pressed together. After a minute or so Angelika sensed Nina relax, and felt her arms move around her back and stoke her. She broke off and smiled at Nina, who could not help but smile back.

They both dried themselves and Angelika did Nina's hair, applying a slight curl to her hair. Then Angelika coaxed Nina out of bed to pick an outfit. They looked through the options, Nina was reluctant but she was resigned at this point, having someone to share this with helped.

After much consideration, Nina tried on the Gryffindor outfit, she felt self-conscious stripping under the unblinking gaze of the cameras and she hurried to get the outfit on. Angelika gave her simple white knickers and bra.

Nina's outfit consisted of a white stocking, a very short red skirt with gold horizontal trim around the edge, a tight white school shirt which ended at her midriff and a Gryffindor school tie, which Angelika adjusted for her. Angelika also picked out skimpy white knickers and bra.

Angelika unselfconsciously stripped and put on the Slytherin outfit, the same apart from the skirt was green and the tie in Slytherin colours.

"You look great," Angelika said admiringly "so sexy". She adjusted Nina's skirt and took the opportunity to gently graze her buttocks with her hand.

"You have really nice skin" Angelika commented. Nina blushed and smiled at the compliment.

Nina closed the wardrobe door and examined herself in the mirror, "Sexy" she thought, before wondering why she thought that in this situation she was in.

Angelika took out a box which she opened and took out two wands, they were thick and buzzed when Angelika switched them on. She handed one to Nina. Both girls giggled and switched them off. It broke the tension a little. Nina this time, made them another drink.

Chidy had chosen well for the first punter. Obasi was a student, and his father back in Nigeria thought he needed to grow up. He had consulted friends and been introduced to Mr Adebayo and arrangements were made. He was young and inexperienced, he might not make a good lover, but he would be a unthreatening introduction to being an escort for Nina.

Obasi had arrived early, nervously waiting outside the address given by his father, before summoning up the courage to ring the doorbell. He had been in an all-boys boarding school after his parents separated, and while a good student and moderate athlete, he had little interaction with girls his age. At 18 he was still a virgin. His father had paid for him to go to University in Britain and worried by his friendship with the other boys at school had thought drastic if not pleasurable measures were to be called upon.

Chidy had opened the door and led him to the living room, where he sat him in an armchair. He handed him a phone with a camera feed to the bedroom downstairs. Obasi grinned.

The cook had come in taken his drink order and came back with a large gin and tonic, and a blue pill on a silver plate. Obasi was sweating slightly and his heart was racing. The gin helped. He gulped down the pill and ogled the two girls. He felt himself getting hard and took another swallow of drink.

Chidy opened the door and spoke greeted Obasi in Yoruba one of the languages in Nigeria, and invited him to meet his date. Chidy led the way out of the room. Obasi commented how nice the house was. "It is an Airbnb, we switch houses every month or so", Chidy replied as he walked down the carpeted stairs to the basement and the green door.

Nina had been waiting nervously sat on the bed, aware of how skimpy her outfit was, which she kept pulling the shirt down to cover more of her leg and knickers while Angelika seemly effortlessly confident and chatted constantly. Nina was only half listening, with conflicting emotions, both scared and bored, but were mind kept going back to what had happened yesterday and how aroused she had felt.

Angelika had poured them larger glasses of the green liquid, the bitterness of the taste hidden by the sugary lemonade, Nina found herself quite like it and it certainly helped relax her, Angelika had also talked her into taking a blue "headache" pill, it was viagra, Angelika knew this was the first time and the Viagra would help her to feel more aroused. It might not make her like it, but it would be less likely to hurt.

They had tried the television but there were only porn channels and neither girl wanted to watch, Nina thinking that it would soon be her turn. So the two girls sat on the bed, talking nervously and occasionally touching each other, seeking comfort.

Eventually, the lock clicked and the door swung open. A young African man stood there, his hair cropped close, he was tall and slim, he looked nervous but never the less aroused when his eyes fell on the two girls. Chidy stood behind him.

Angelika stood up and gave him a dazzling smile. "Hi Baby, come in" She gushed. Obasi stepped over the threshold and Chidy closed the door behind him.

"I am Angelika and this is Nina, what do we call you sir?" Angelika continued as she reached up to kiss him.

"I am Obasi" Obasi said his eyes wide and filled with desire, "I am very pleased to meet you".

"Can I get you a drink Mr Obasi? Angelika asked solicitously.

"Yeah thank you, a Coke" Obasi said ogling the tight outfits the girls were wearing, "one blonde and one brunette, very nice, very nice"

"You go and sit next to Nina while I will get your drink," Angelika said. Nina managed a semblance of a smile, but was relieved that Angelika was here to handle this, she thought there was no way she could have.

Obediently Obasi sat next to Nina, "Hello Nina, I am Obasi" Obasi said, his eyes staring at Nina's top.

Nina forced a smile "I'm Nina, pleased to meet you" she said shyly mimicking Angelika.

While Angelika poured drinks she went on "This is Nina's first-time Obasi", she turned with the drinks in her hand, "You will be her first", she tilted her head down, looking up, subservient to Obasi as she handed Obasi a glass of Coke and Nina the same, Nina nervously took a big sip and nearly choked, it must have been half vodka.

Angelika sat down next to Obasi with him in the middle between her and Nina. Her hand went down and stroked his leg.

"So Mr Obasi what do you like" she purred.

"Err" Obasi hesitated, "many things" despite the gin he was nervous. He would soon relax.

"Well Obasi sir, whatever you want, we will do for your tonight anything" she said huskily.

Obasi grinned, Nina could see his erection growing in his trousers.

Angelika sensed how nervous this youth was so she jumped off the bed, "let's put some music on, what sort of music do you like Obasi? " she asked.

"Rap, drill, what every"

Angelika took the remote and switched the television on changing it to a music channel, she found a suitable station and set the volume.

"Come and dance Obasi" Angelika said, "come on Nina, let's dance together". Obasi and Nina stood up. Since both girls were barefoot Obasi slipped his shoes off, he may have been young but he was a good dancer, his hands getting more and more intimate with each girls. The short skirts gave him easy access to their buttocks. He loved this.

"Harry Potter right?" Obasi asked looking at the outfits the girls were wearing.

"Yes" Angelika replied, "I love Harry Potter"

"So you're Gryndoor" he said to Nina, his hands on her midriff "And you're Slytherin" he said looking at Angelika.

"Yes, Nina is the good girl" Angelika said teasingly "and I am the bad girl. Let me show you". Angelika got closer to Nina and kissed her, full on the lips, it caught Nina off guard.

"Hmmm, that's sexy" said Obasi stroking the back of Angelika "do that again".

"Nina?" Angelika said sexily an impish smile playing on her lips. This time Nina was ready and she closed her eyes as their lips met, she felt a little drunk and this was actually nice, especially when Angelika's tongue touched hers. She felt Angelika's hands sliding up her leg and pulling up her skirt. Obasi joined in lifting both girl's skirts up.

Angelika broke off and kissed Obasi, his hands switched to her breasts. She broke off and took Nina's hand and pulled her closer to Obasi, Nina caught in the moment kissed him, she could taste the Coke, and feel his firm body and the erection in his trousers. She could not believe that she was relaxed now and excited.

Angelika said softly "Do you want to watch us Mr Obasi? Do you want to watch girl on girl?"

Obasi wide eyed and open-mouthed nodded his head vigorously. "Oh yes" he muttered in English before saying something in his native Nigerian.

Angelika grabbed Nina's hand and led her to the bed.

"You sit there Sir" Angelika told Obasi indicating the Charisse lounge.

They climbed onto the bed, Angelika slapping Nina's buttocks playfully. Nina even giggled at this. They kneeled facing each other and kissed fondling each other's hair, before Angelika slipped her hand down and lifted up Nina's skirt to give Obasi a better view of her buttocks.

After a minute, Angelika lifted Nina's shirt and bra up exposing her breasts and started kissing her nipples. Both girls heard Obasi groan, Angelika stole a glance and the young black man was entranced with watching them.

Angelika gently pushed Nina to the bed, she pulled up Nina's skirt and started to pull down Nina's knickers, Nina lifted her hips so that Angelika could ease them off and Angelika slid them along her silky smooth legs. Angelika threw them at Obasi, who grinning, caught them.

Angelika kissed Nina's midriff before going further down, ending at her vagina. She gently sucked on her clitoris. Nina could not help but moan softly, as she spread her legs wider. The sensation of Angelika's tonged on her vulva was mind blowing to the sexually aroused Nina.

Due to the Viagra, the extra blood flow made Nina's vulva particularly sensitive. She was getting very aroused. She unconsciously murmured while trying to stop herself enjoying this.

Nina had her eyes closed as she focused on the pleasure she was receiving from Angelika. She could not help herself moaning in pleasure. In her mind, she was pictured being taken by Mr Aboiya again in the same way he had completely dominated her yesterday and raped her, in her fantasy she was tied up, unable to move, naked and vulnerable. Mr Aboiya was a huge man, strong and angry, who mounted her and took her with a frightening savagery. Between the aphrodisiacs, stimulates and the alcohol Nina had lost herself to the moment

The sight of the two girls having sex was too much for Obasi, he stood up and stripped. Angelika heard him and turned to give an encouraging smile. He stripped as fast as he could, nearly tripping over his trousers as he pulled them off. His erection was proud but aching with desire.

Angelika started to sit up but Obasi said "Not stop girl". He positioned himself behind Angelika and lifted her skirt up, she was not wearing knickers, and her buttocks were firm and smooth. Obasi slid his naked penis along her vulva seeking out the entrance to her vagina.

Angelika took some lubricant from a tube next to the bed and squirted some on her hand. She felt between her legs and gently took his penis in her hand, coating it with the lubricant, before guiding him into her vagina. While doing so she looked up and grinned encouragingly to Nina. As Obasi entered her, she closed her eyes, grimacing as Obasi slammed away at her.

Obasi was in heaven, he had never before been this aroused and he had two beautiful white girls as his playthings. The girl he was in was gripping his penis with her vagina and getting the brown haired girl off, he would have her next. It was not long before Obasi felt an overwhelming urge and he came inside Angelika, he roared as he came feeling strong and powerful.

Obasi pulled out of Angelika, cum dripping from his naked black penis onto the bed covers. "Why don't you lie down here" Angelika indicated the middle of the bed, "Nina wants you".

Obasi did as suggested, he lay down with a happy and excited smile on his face, his erection still prominent.

Nina looked at this young man, still really a boy, she had been turned on by watching him have sex with Angelika. But she was so conflicted by her arousal and her feelings about herself. She resigned herself to doing this one thing to win freedom for herself and her love, she tried to believe she was not enjoying this.

Angelika stood up and took some tissues from a box in the nightstand drawer, she used them to catch the copious amounts of cum which was leaking from her vagina and running coldly down her leg.

She saw Nina was hesitant, so she came behind her, with one had she slid it around Nina's slender body and started playing his her nipples, the other hand took her long brunette hair in a bunch so she could kiss her neck, she looked up to see Obasi eagerly watch them, stroking his erection.

Angelika moved her free hand down and around to be able to play with Nina' clitoris, she could feel how wet she was.

"Okay Nina, now you go on top" she whispered urgently.

Upstairs Chidy's eyes narrowed as he watched the screen intently. This was the make-or-break point.

Nina moved forward on her knees and straddled Obasi, Angelika came behind her and lifted her top exposing her breasts, Nina felt between her legs to find his erect penis and positioned it underneath her vagina and slowly lowered herself guiding him into her. In her mind she was screaming "What am I doing" but she had accepted what she felt was the inevitable, the words of a song only dimly remembers, "sweet surrender".

Obasi naked penis was now fully inside, and it felt hard, Nina started gyrating her hips, as Angelika reached around and started playing with her nipples again.

Nina placed her hands on Obasi's chest and started to ride him, Angelika whispered in her ear, "Make like you are orgasming, he will like that", Nina did not have to pretend, she panted and moaned as he bounced up and down on this naked penis. She forgot everything other than the urgency of the need to orgasm, the desire building up like an intense pressure.

Nina's muscles tensed across her body and they squeezed Obasi's penis most pleasurably, almost like she was trying to push him out of her. The merging of the physical and mental made Nina a little scared but the desire to cum was overwhelming. She felt tense all over, her head began to throb. Then it hit her, not like a wave this time, like an avalanche. Even Angelika was surprised by the enthusiastic noises. Nina collapsed onto Obasis's chest, his penis still embedded in her.

Obasi grinned like a Cheshire cat, and stroked her hair as she panted and recovered her strength.

Eventually, even Obasi was exhausted, he lay in the middle of the big bed, gently sleeping. The two girls cuddled up on each side. Angelika lifted her head up and nodded to Nina, she got up and silently padded her way to the bathroom, Nina followed and both girls washed up. Nina realised that Obasi had not ejaculated inside her or at least if he had it was only a tiny amount.

Angelika fetched two skimpy soft silky negligees, Nina put hers on and wondered "is it much better than being naked".

Nina quietly climbed into the bed next to Obasi, she did not want to wake him. She was tired and did not want to think about what had happened. She closed her eyes, trying to picture Des, somehow she couldn't. Eventually sleep overcame her and she drifted off, into a deep but troubled sleep.

Obasi woke up in the early hours. He was still aroused, he could feel the heat of the two white girls on either side of him. He started stroking the one on the left, it was Nina and it woke her up, she sleepily groaned quietly. Obasi's hand went to her crotch, she was not wearing knickers, and started to touch her vagina, his inexperience showed, and to avoid this hurting she reluctantly took his hand and showed him where and how to touch her. Using the tip of his index finger to play with her clitoris.

Nina focussed his fingers on her clitoris, despite the hour, Nina's wilful body responded, it felt good and she opened her legs wider, and coaxed him to use both his middle and index fingers.

The activity woke Angelika who realised what was going on and took out a tube of lubricate, she reached around and expertly started to stoke Obasi's shaft, but not before she had squirted some onto Obasi's hand. This made it much more pleasurable for Nina, who became more aroused.

Obasi was quickly hard, and he lifted the duvet off Nina and manoeuvred himself over her so he could mount her. Nina was still sleepy but resigned herself to this unwanted attention, the naked head of Obasi's cock pressed against her vagina and she used her hand to guide his penis into her, closing her eyes as the head of his penis entered her. She let out the breath she had been holding.

"Argeehhh" he cried in satisfaction, his cock felt harder than it had ever had before and he needed release for his teenage desires. He thrust bucking inexactly trying to make up for the lack of experience with enthusiasm.

Obasi came, he gave a long drawn out howl as he shot his seed into Nina, he rolled off her and rested from his exertions. Nina full awake now, was left unsatisfied, she had been woken up and aroused but had not climaxed. She got up to clean herself and by the time she got back both Obasi and Angelika were asleep again.

Nina woke to feel the bed shaking and the moans of Angelika. Obasi was on top of her, and Angelika had her legs across his shoulders. Obasi was young and healthy and had found a new sexual appetite. Cumming multiple meant he lasted longer now and Angelika looked like she was enjoying the attention. She glanced over and and saw Nina watching them, she threw her hand over to Nina took it, Angelika smiled and closed her eyes, her lips making an "O" as she approached orgasm.

After Anglika had washed up she came back into the room. Obasi was lying next to Nina kissing her, his penis astonishingly still erect. "Lie down Mr Obasi" She said "we will do a massage for you now".

Angelika motioned for Nina to strip and both girls took oil and Angelia showed Nina how to massage a punter. Obasi wanted to find out about the girls and Nina was thankful that Angelika did the talking for both of them.

There was another knock at the door, and a voice called "Times Up".

Obasi dressed quickly watching the two girls on the bed. He looked still very young, but had more of a swagger about him now.

"That was amazing" he said "I am coming back to see you real soon"

Angelika got up followed by Nina, both girls took turns kissing Obasi. Angelika cheekily rubbing his penis through his trousers.

"Bye" he said as he opened the door and left.

Angelika turned to Nina, "Well done, that must have been tough for you, but you did really well. He looked pleased didn't he? We might get a tip now" she gabbled as changed into her things.

"What happens now?" Nina asked.

"Well I am going home, Angelika said, she looked in the wardrobe "Where are your things?"

Nina shrugged "I don't know, they kept them, and I need to get to work". It seemed odd to be talking about mundane things like work. It felt even older to think it had been just 2 days, it seemed like weeks she had been captured.

"I will ask Rudy for them" and with that she vanished through the door, leaving it ajar.

Nina sat on the ottoman, in the bathrobe wondering if she should go out or wait.

Nina did not have to wait long, the old cook brought in Nina's dress and thing.

"The car will be out front in 10 minutes" he said and turned around and left before Nina could question him. "What an odd man" Nina thought, rightly guessing that was Rudy, "at least he left me alone."

Along with her dress was her bag underwear and shoes. Relief rushed through her as this may be over. Nina grabbed her things and hurriedly dressed trying to hide herself from the cameras.

Once fully clothed She felt more like herself. She tried the door and it was open, she headed out, heart racing, she climbed the stairs at a trot, it somehow seemed so different but seemed so familiar. No one was on the landing, the door was tantalisingly close. She tried the door handle and found it was unlocked, just on the latch. She opened it and stepped out. The air tasted sweet and the sun felt good. She stepped out of the house, relief washing over her. "This nightmare is finally over" she thought, not feeling it was a nightmare.

There was a man standing in front of a car on the street directly by the house, he opened the door to the back seat and looked expectantly at Nina. Nina was suddenly wary. The man noted her alarm "Mr Adebayo told me to take you home, no stress" he said in a friendly tone

Nina thought this over, she needed to call to work, and she wanted to get home. They had let her go so why would they go back on that, she thought? But tiredness overcame her caution and she got in ear seat. The man climbed in the drivers seat and checked her in his mirror. He indicated and pulled out.

Nina watched the quiet suburban streets, mums pushing babies, people walking dogs, delivery drivers dropping parcels, it was all very normal but she did not feel normal. She thought about work, she could see from the clock on the car that it was nearly 11, not a great time to call in sick.

"Can I use your phone" she asked the driver. He just grunted and handed her a cheap plastic phone.

"Its #2468 to unlock it" he said and went back to focussing on the road. Nina dialled in the main office number she recognised the voice of the receptionist.

"Melissa its me, I need to speak to David"

After terminating the call Nina thought of calling Des, his was the only number she had memorised. But she did not want this man to hear or to report back, She slipped the phone onto the front passenger seat, "thank you" she said and watched the through the window.

An hour water Nina was sat in her kitchen, she felt numb. confused and not knowing what to do. She no longer had any desire to see Des. She didn't know what she wanted. She toyed with her phone, it had been posted through her letter box. Eventually she looked up a number and rang it.
